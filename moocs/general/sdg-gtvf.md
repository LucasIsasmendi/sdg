## 1. Sustainable Development as a Global Goal
### A history of sustainable development
Humanity finds itself at, perhaps, the most exciting and challenging juncture in its history. Once we've used the natural resources upon which we are dependent, those resources will not be replenished. 

A possible explanation for the long gap between having evidence of resource limitation and its acknowledgment in the political arena might be that once you acknowledge something is limited, you then have to begin to consider how that something is going to be shared.

Our Common Future published in 1987, aka The Brundtland Report, made two very important points:
1. it emphasized the importance of `intergenerational equity`: we must not, through our resource use, today, lower potential living standards of future generations.
2. sustainable development must include, in addition to consideration of economic sustainability, also environmental and social sustainability.

At the time of the Brundtland Report, however, it was not really possible to define what was meant by environmental and social sustainability. The past 30 years has brought us much closer to an understanding of these two sustainability components. And they've been specified in many of the sustainable development goals. In essence, environmental sustainability requires that the human demand for resources is brought to and maintained within the global supply of these resources. And social sustainability demands that certain basal human rights are respected.

### How do we measure progress?
There are 17 Sustainable Development Goals. Many argue that it's too many, and indeed, 17 is a pretty unwieldy number for any country or organization to work with.
In all, the SDGs are comprised of 169 targets and 230 indicators for monitoring status of progress.

These indicators represent the best methodology we have available today. But many need to be further developed, perhaps even changed to something entirely different in order to effectively measure global progress against the SDGs.
And for essentially all targets, we're missing data from many parts of the world. Therefore, there needs to be a focus on both metric development and data collection in order to accurately assess global progress against the SDGs.
The lack of quantitative metrics for measuring the SDGs (target 17.19) is actually serving as a kind of catalyst in focusing research to develop metrics that can be applied to assess sustainability. 

Peter Birch Sorensen (professor in Environmental Economics, University of Copenhagen) SDG#8: GDP stands for gross domestic products, but it does not account for the costs to the environment of economic activity, is not an indicator of human welfare. We need something to supplement GDP.
The green GDP, as we call it, is an attempt to at least make sure that we account for, as best we can, the effects of economic activity on the environment.  There are many controversial issues involved in estimating green GDP. But there is a growing demand for it because there's this growing recognition that ecosystem services and environmental goods are becoming increasingly scarce relative to the goods we produce in the marketplace.
We should try to put a price on environmental goods and services, say, via pollution taxes so that we as consumers or business firms are confronted with the environmental costs of their actions. 

Engineer, Professor Michael Zwicky Hauschild, from the Technical University of Denmark, work related to SDG#12.
We should start with meeting the needs of present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.
If we all share the same space, each one have a budget of greenhouse gas emissions, how much can your activities cause release of every year?
We know, at least theoretically, what sustainability is when we talk about production and consumption, but we really don't have the mechanisms yet to be able to label a single product as being sustainable, but it could come that there's lots of research going on.
I think it's very promising actually to work on different ways of taxing products based on their environmental impact because we can put numbers in the environmental impact. That would be a way of using the market to direct demand in the direction of the more sustainable products.

### SDG Interactions – One for All and All for One!
There is a tendency to cherry pick SDGs, which makes very difficult to envision activities that do not have both negative and positive effects on the SDGs overall. We can not achieve a sustainable development trajectory unless we simultaneously work to reduce negative impacts at the same time we exploit the positive interactions.

Numerous studies have been carried out since the adoption of the 2030 agenda in which the interactions between different SDGs are mapped, most of then only consider a subset of the goals (g.e: ICSU, 2, 3, 7, 14). 

A further challenge in relating SDGs to sustainable development is that politicians and other social decision makers, or societal decision makers, do not actually think in terms of SDGs. Therefore, it's difficult to relate the SDGs to everyday decision making.

Bruce Campbell, the director for the research program, Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security under the CGIAR, explains food system interactions with SDG: it actually has multiple interactions. So the first one is, no poverty, so agricultural development is a key part of the poverty alleviation agenda. Obviously, it's connection with food, no hunger. It's got a connection to the water one. The biodiversity ones, both of those, agriculture production is a key driver of biodiversity change, climate change. So those are some of the big ones with agriculture production, but even all the others you can find linkages. So, for example the gender one, there's a massive feminization of agriculture in developing countries. So you can go through the list and you can find linkages to almost all the SDGs.

We believe that you have to work right across the scales, right from a farmer's field to national level policies, to global level policies, and they all have to come together. 
But some of the real solutions lie at the level of countries and farms in landscapes. 

Do you really believe that we can have sustainable development and still feed 9 to 10 billion people? Yes, the production in many developing countries is way below the potential, five, six, seven, ten times below the potential. So we can increase the amount of food production, but we have to do it through sustainable intensification. It can't be at the spreading through more forest land and those sorts of things.

What about agriculture and biodiversity? agriculture's had a massive impact on biodiversity. On the land, it accounts for more than 70% of global deforestation, and it's the major driver of land cover change on the globe, also use 70% of the fresh water. And I think that most of us see the solution as sustainable intensification. This approach where you produce more with, essentially, less inputs.
Sustainable development isn't possible unless we change the agricultural system. The rice subsector gives the same emissions as the aviation industry, for example. And the aviation industry seems to be taking some degree of seriousness about climate change but not the rice sector.

> The take home message then is that the SDGs are all interlinked and need to be considered in the musketeer spirit. All for one, and one for all. Only in that manner can we begin to think and regulate in the system context that actually describes the world we live in.
