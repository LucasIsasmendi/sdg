## Get Started
I'm Dr Fiona Borthwick and I'm excited to welcome you to Sustainable Global Food Systems.
My background is in Environmental Science and Policy, and my interest in food systems comes from my work on resource management, particularly in regions of conflict, as well as sustainable agriculture.

This course will introduce you to the key elements of food systems, food security and sustainability. We will explore the different stages of food systems and the environmental and social impacts that are occurring. We will also introduce you to some of the ways we measure the impacts of food systems, as well as how we might develop solutions to the negative impacts associated with global food systems. 

The course has been developed by the Global Academy of Agriculture and Food Security (GAAFS) at the University of Edinburgh. 

## 1. Introduction to Food Systems
> **Systems, Security and Sustainability**

### What is a sustainable food system?
The food system represents all the stages that food goes through, including buying it and eating it.

The key stages of a food system are: production, aggregation, processing, distribution, and consumption, as well as waste.

Simple food systems are mainly related to unprocessed or minimally processed foods.
Processed foods are those that have been treated with salt, brine, oil, sugar, or other additives to make them more palatable or to preserve them.
Today, most processed foods are manufactured by industrial processes.
Ultra-processed foods are those that are produced predominantly by industrial processes.
An increasing proportion of people's diets are in the processed and ultra-processed category.
Making sure each ingredient meets specific requirements of quality and safety, for example, is very difficult.
There are systems that have been developed to try to guarantee a certain standard.

Sustainability across the food system is very important.
The basic definition of sustainability is that the current population can meet its needs without preventing future generations from meeting theirs.
For something to be truly sustainable, there should be no impact on the environment, on the people involved in it at every stage, and it should be viable economically.

The consumer is a key factor in the sustainability of the food system.

To understand food systems, we can collect big datasets and carry out modelling of the systems to predict what might work to reduce the impact of the food we eat on people, and, on the planet.

### Frameworks to assess sustainability
All of these approaches to sustainable food production aim to change practice in food systems, but they also rely on having good data to determine what the environmental or social impacts of production are, to make changes to behaviour and then to see if there have been improvements. 

#### **Life cycle and carbon footprints**
One way of considering sustainability is to look at the impacts of the food system. This can be done by using `life cycle analysis` (LCA), which is a process of describing the entire life of a product. [life cycle initiative](https://www.lifecycleinitiative.org/)

A similar method is to focus on one specific impact ‚Äì greenhouse gas emissions for example. You can collect data on the GHG emissions across the food system, and combine that into a value ‚Äì often described as a volume called a `footprint`. This then allows you to compare similar products, or combine the footprint of an individual‚Äôs consumption to estimate their total footprint. [Carbon Footprint Calculator (UN)](https://offset.climateneutralnow.org/footprintcalc)

#### **Sustainability standards**
Many sustainability standards are designed to shift behaviour towards sustainable practices across production systems, as well as give consumers information so that they can make choices between similar products. Most standards are voluntary.

A sustainable standard sets out what a food producer must or must not do in order to be considered sustainable. The standards are agreed by industry as well as external organisations who want to stop impact from agriculture.

Examples:
-  [Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil](https://rspo.org/)
-  [Rainforest Alliance](https://www.rainforest-alliance.org/): closely connected issues that are vital to global sustainability
-  [Fairtrade](https://www.fairtrade.org.uk/): over 6,000 Fairtrade products

#### **Integrated Farm Management (IFM)**
A way to run the farm as a sustainable business by looking at all aspects of the farm, as well as the community.

There are nine elements of an IFM approach:
1. Organisation and planning (having as much data as possible to plan and track improvements)
2. Soil management and fertility
3. Crop health and protection
4. Pollution control and by-product management
5. Animal husbandry
6. Energy efficiency
7. Water management
8. Landscape and nature conservation
9. Community engagement

### Sustainable development principles
> ‚ÄúSustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.‚Äù ~ Our Common Future (The Brundtland Report)

At its heart, sustainable development seeks to balance meeting essential needs, particularly of the vulnerable and poor, while recognising that there are limits to the natural systems that humans utilise for many resources.

#### **Key principles**
- Inter- and intragenerational equity
- The precautionary principle: sometimes it is better to take action to address or avoid a problem even in the absence of definitive scientific proof of causality
- The voluntary principle: using sustainable certification and standards. Voluntary action can be enacted quicker than changing or creating new laws
- The polluter pays principle: often we see that governments and the wider society pay the price for pollution
- Assisting poorer communities and countries: 
- Environmental limits: allow ecosystems to function without being degraded by our economic activities

#### **Weak vs strong sustainable development**
- Weak: restore the ecosystem after operations
- Strong: withou negative environmental or social impact

### The four dimensions of food security
Access, availability, utilisation, and stability.

While there are over 800 million undernourished people who are
experiencing chronic or acute food insecurity. There are 2 billion people lacking key micronutrients and 2 billion adults who are overweight or obese.

### Activity: Your food shop
Describe the four key dimensions of food security in relation to your own food shop.

### Data: What is social network analysis (SNA)?
Social network analysis can be used to described the relationships across a food system. This can help to identify who influences the behaviour across the system and who has developed new sustainable ways of working. It can also help to understand resilience, for example how supply chains adapt to shocks and big changes.

There are many software programmes you can use to generate SNA diagrams. One that is free to use is [Gephi](https://gephi.org/).

### Activity: Draw a food system
1. Choose a food item
2. Think about the stages of the food system that food item goes through.
3. Sketch the food system for your item 
4. Share your drawing on the padlet board and spend time reviewing your peers‚Äô posts
