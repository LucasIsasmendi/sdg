## 1. Introduction to the Global Food System
### Transformation of the global food system - Introduction
We must accept that we are part of a bigger system and without addressing the full implications of our actions, sustainable development of our society is impossible to achieve.

My name is Katherine Richardson. Back in 2009, I was part of a research team that presented the so-called **"planetary boundaries"**. Science tells us that humans impact the Earth at the global level. With the planetary boundaries, we are trying to examine how much we can let our activities impact the Earth System without running the risk of our impact leading to drastic changes in the conditions we experience on Earth.

We identify nine processes in the Earth System where our impacts could potentially lead to a change in the overall Earth conditions. Impact levels from [0] to [5]:
 - `Climate change` [2]
 - Novel entities [3+]
 - Stratopheric ozone depletion [0+]
 - Atmospheric aerosol loading [3+]
 - Ocean Acidification [1+]
 - `Biochemical flows`
   - Phosporous [4]
   - Nitrogen [5]
- Freshwater use [0+]
- `Land-system change` [3]
- `Biosphere integrity`
  - Functional diversity [3+]
  - Genetic diversity [5]

For four of these, Climate change, Biochemical flows, Land-system change and Biosphere integrity, our studies suggest that we have moved out of the safe operating space. In other words, our impact on these processes is already so great that it increases the risk of dramatic changes in the conditions we experience on Earth. 

Recognizing that our activities impact the Earth at the global level makes it painfully clear the need for changing the way we do many things. We need to ensure that the value society obtains from our activities comes with a minimal environmental cost.

Making sure that our demand for the Earth's resources is held to within the supply of these resources is, however, only half of the sustainability challenge. Kate Raworth, an economist at Oxford, describes the second half of the challenge. Kate identifies a doughnut-shaped space where sustainable development can occur. The outer ring on the doughnut is determined by the planetary boundaries. The inner ring by the need to secure a minimum standard of living for all human beings.
With regard to food, the two sides of the sustainability challenge are abundantly clear. On the one hand, more than 800 million people globally are chronically undernourished, while on the other, our food systems are releasing about a third of all greenhouse gases. They are also responsible for about 80% of our loss of biodiversity. Therefore, scaling up food systems as we know them today is simply not an option if we are to feed a world population that is expected to be at nine to ten billion in 2050.

> **What is needed within our global food systems then is not an upscaling, but a transformation.**

Starting with a production focus and moving towards the consumer, four vital parts of this transformation can be identified: 
1. Boosting the small
2. Tansforming the big
3. Losing less
4. Eating smarter.

New technology is not enough. Government intervention will be required, as will improved finance and behavioral change from both citizens and consumers. 
As young protesters cry across the globe: There is no planet B!

### TED talk (Video): Kate Raworth – A healthy economy should be designed to thrive, not grow

[TED talk link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rhcrbcg8HBw)

At country level, we are obsessed with growth GDP (since was invented in 1930) and mass consumption.
- We are financially addicted to gowth because today's financial system is designed to pursue the highest rate of monetary return.
- We are politically addicted to gowth because politicians want to raise tax revenue without raising taxes and a growing GDP is the way to do that
- We are socially addicted to gowth because thanks to a century of consumer propaganda, which fascinatingly was created by Edward Bernays the nephew of Sigmun Freud. He created a very lucrative retail therapy, make us believe that we transform ourselves every time we buy something more.

Global GDP is 10x bigger than it was in 1950, which has brought prosperity to billions of people. Bit the global economy has also become incredibly diviside, with the vast share of returns to wealth now ocurring to a fraction of the global 1%. And the economy has become incredibly degenerative, rapidly destabilizing this delicately balanced planet.

**doughnut framework**: We cannot let our collective resource use overshoot that outer circle, the ecological ceiling. Is a dynamic balance. We are far from balance right now: falling short and overshooting at the same time.
This is our selfie, we the people of 21st century. No economist from last century saw this picture, so why would we imagine that their theories would be up for taking on its challenges?
**We need ideas of our own, because we are the first generation to see this and probably the last with a real chance of turning this story around**

More gowth won't clean things up again.

We need to create economies that tackle this shortfall and overshoot together, by design. **We need economies that are REGENERATIVE and DISTRIBUTIVE by design.**
We have inherited degenerative industries: `TAKE(from planet) -> MAKE -> USE  -> LOSE`

We need to `REGENERATE` biological materials and `RESTORE` technical materials and avoid `TAKE`. Where waste from one process is food for the next.

This century we can design our technologies and institutions to distribute wealth,knowledge and empowerment to many. 

**When something tries to grows forever within a healthy, living, thriving system, it's a threat to the health of the whole.**

Focus on thriving and balance, within the social and the ecological boundaries of the doughnut. The world's most ingenious people turn boundaries into the source of their creativity. It's boundaries that unleash our potential. 

### The food system and its links
- How are each of the Earth System components, which are depicted and conceptualized through the planetary boundaries (see figure below), connected to our food systems? (read Campbell et al. 2017)

Why won’t new technologies alone solve the challenges in front of us? (Hints: Think, for example, of biodiversity loss and [Jevon’s Paradox](#jevons-paradox))

The term `Jevons Paradox` flags the need to consider the different hierarchical scales at which a system under analysis changes its identity in response to an innovation.
When studying evolution and real change how can we define “what has to be sustained” in a system that continuously becomes something else?
