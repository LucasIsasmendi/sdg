## 1. Introduction to the Global Food System
### Transformation of the global food system - Introduction
We must accept that we are part of a bigger system and without addressing the full implications of our actions, sustainable development of our society is impossible to achieve.

My name is Katherine Richardson. Back in 2009, I was part of a research team that presented the so-called **"planetary boundaries"**. Science tells us that humans impact the Earth at the global level. With the planetary boundaries, we are trying to examine how much we can let our activities impact the Earth System without running the risk of our impact leading to drastic changes in the conditions we experience on Earth.

We identify nine processes in the Earth System where our impacts could potentially lead to a change in the overall Earth conditions. Impact levels from [0] to [5]:
 - `Climate change` [2]
 - Novel entities [3+]
 - Stratopheric ozone depletion [0+]
 - Atmospheric aerosol loading [3+]
 - Ocean Acidification [1+]
 - `Biochemical flows`
   - Phosporous [4]
   - Nitrogen [5]
- Freshwater use [0+]
- `Land-system change` [3]
- `Biosphere integrity`
  - Functional diversity [3+]
  - Genetic diversity [5]

For four of these, Climate change, Biochemical flows, Land-system change and Biosphere integrity, our studies suggest that we have moved out of the safe operating space. In other words, our impact on these processes is already so great that it increases the risk of dramatic changes in the conditions we experience on Earth. 

Recognizing that our activities impact the Earth at the global level makes it painfully clear the need for changing the way we do many things. We need to ensure that the value society obtains from our activities comes with a minimal environmental cost.

Making sure that our demand for the Earth's resources is held to within the supply of these resources is, however, only half of the sustainability challenge. Kate Raworth, an economist at Oxford, describes the second half of the challenge. Kate identifies a doughnut-shaped space where sustainable development can occur. The outer ring on the doughnut is determined by the planetary boundaries. The inner ring by the need to secure a minimum standard of living for all human beings.
With regard to food, the two sides of the sustainability challenge are abundantly clear. On the one hand, more than 800 million people globally are chronically undernourished, while on the other, our food systems are releasing about a third of all greenhouse gases. They are also responsible for about 80% of our loss of biodiversity. Therefore, scaling up food systems as we know them today is simply not an option if we are to feed a world population that is expected to be at nine to ten billion in 2050.

> **What is needed within our global food systems then is not an upscaling, but a transformation.**

Starting with a production focus and moving towards the consumer, four vital parts of this transformation can be identified: 
1. Boosting the small
2. Tansforming the big
3. Losing less
4. Eating smarter.

New technology is not enough. Government intervention will be required, as will improved finance and behavioral change from both citizens and consumers. 
As young protesters cry across the globe: There is no planet B!

### TED talk (Video): Kate Raworth – A healthy economy should be designed to thrive, not grow

[TED talk link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rhcrbcg8HBw)

At country level, we are obsessed with growth GDP (since was invented in 1930) and mass consumption.
- We are financially addicted to gowth because today's financial system is designed to pursue the highest rate of monetary return.
- We are politically addicted to gowth because politicians want to raise tax revenue without raising taxes and a growing GDP is the way to do that
- We are socially addicted to gowth because thanks to a century of consumer propaganda, which fascinatingly was created by Edward Bernays the nephew of Sigmun Freud. He created a very lucrative retail therapy, make us believe that we transform ourselves every time we buy something more.

Global GDP is 10x bigger than it was in 1950, which has brought prosperity to billions of people. Bit the global economy has also become incredibly diviside, with the vast share of returns to wealth now ocurring to a fraction of the global 1%. And the economy has become incredibly degenerative, rapidly destabilizing this delicately balanced planet.

**doughnut framework**: We cannot let our collective resource use overshoot that outer circle, the ecological ceiling. Is a dynamic balance. We are far from balance right now: falling short and overshooting at the same time.
This is our selfie, we the people of 21st century. No economist from last century saw this picture, so why would we imagine that their theories would be up for taking on its challenges?
**We need ideas of our own, because we are the first generation to see this and probably the last with a real chance of turning this story around**

More gowth won't clean things up again.

We need to create economies that tackle this shortfall and overshoot together, by design. **We need economies that are REGENERATIVE and DISTRIBUTIVE by design.**
We have inherited degenerative industries: `TAKE(from planet) -> MAKE -> USE  -> LOSE`

We need to `REGENERATE` biological materials and `RESTORE` technical materials and avoid `TAKE`. Where waste from one process is food for the next.

This century we can design our technologies and institutions to distribute wealth,knowledge and empowerment to many. 

**When something tries to grows forever within a healthy, living, thriving system, it's a threat to the health of the whole.**

Focus on thriving and balance, within the social and the ecological boundaries of the doughnut. The world's most ingenious people turn boundaries into the source of their creativity. It's boundaries that unleash our potential. 

### The food system and its links
- How are each of the Earth System components, which are depicted and conceptualized through the planetary boundaries (see figure below), connected to our food systems? (read Campbell et al. 2017)

<img src="../food/img/totgfs-1.2-agriculture%20and%20planetary%20boundaries.png" width="50%">

Why won’t new technologies alone solve the challenges in front of us? (Hints: Think, for example, of biodiversity loss and [Jevon’s Paradox](#jevons-paradox))

## 2. Boosting the Small
### Increasing know-how
The story of our current food system begins in Nigeria, Africa. By 2050 the world has to feed an additional 2 billion people, and it is here, in Africa, that most of them will live.
Smallholder farmers, that means farmers with only a couple of hectares of land, are key to feeding future populations. In 2030, it is expected there will be 750 million of these smallholder farmers worldwide.
As a start, these farmers need more knowledge concerning best practice, both because the knowledge can increase output, but also because it can contribute to improved land management.
Best practices are the small simple steps, that can make a huge impact, when looking at the overall agricultural yield of Africa. These are small skills and techniques, that farmers apply to increase the yield of their crops. It is either around the right spacing for crops, the right time to apply fertilizers or herbicides or fungicides. It is around how and where to get the right seed,

### Natural nitrogen fixation
A major challenge, facing the farmers in Africa in their daily work, is getting access to nitrogen to support plant growth.

Access to nitrogen is a double-edged sword in terms of sustainable development. Too much on your soils is a bad thing, as it causes contamination of groundwater, eutrophication of freshwater and estuarine ecosystems, atmospheric pollution and soil acidification as well as soil degradation. On the flip side, too little nitrogen results in low production yields, soil nutrient mining and soil degradation. All of these consequences lead to poor human nutrition.

Ken Giller has specialized in putting the plants that can fix nitrogen to use for small-scale farmers in Africa. These plants are called legumes: peas and beans. They provide protein, minerals, particularly for people in their diets.
They are very good in terms of the fact that they fix nitrogen from the air. 
The bacteria Rhizobium is what inyects nitrogen. So seed and bacterium needs to go togheter. By ussing legumes, smallholder farmers can boost their production with less amounts of fertilizers. Legumes are often grown with maize.
Efficient use of nitrogen fertilizers is also important in Africa.

### Better access to finance
In Costa Rica, the major obstacle for many small- and medium-sized farms is finance. Loans and investments are important for a farmer to conduct her business. But in many rural areas, interest rates for microcredit are around 35% per year.

Through public-private partnerships, public funds can be made available to support an innovative private sector, with the right experience and the knowledge to make changes in the food system.

Tips:
- tailor finance programmes to the specific needs of different farmers
- adjust the conditions of payment, period of grace, the type of guarantee depending on the project.
- follow up and support in the transformations that have to be made
- create good results: better income, less environmental impact and greater social impact on the community

### Sharing economy
Hello Tractor: rent a tractor for a period of time. For farmers with average 1,8 to 3 hectares. Usually a farmer starts to get mechanized around 5 hectares, but Hello Tractor is opening up the opportunity to receive mechanization, even when you're below that level.
Mechanization is so crucial in the crop production cycle for farmers. It has the ability to really increase and impact the yields of the farmers and their revenue in so many ways. The ability to plant 40 time faster with mechanization than manual labor. Their ability to increase up to 40% their revenue stream. And it's really, at the core, an opportunity for them to reach their potential revenue and by relying on agriculture to improve food security - because *Africa has the biggest arable land available today on Earth*.

Hello Tractor depends on booking agents. These agents are specialized farmers, who speak English fluently and possess a smartphone. When a farmer wants a tractor service he goes to our booking agents. Basically, the booking agent role is to mitigate the fact, that farmers don't necessarily use Android phones and smartphones. So they place the orders on their behalf.

In vast countries like Nigeria, where the population is very dispersed, demand for mechanized equipment is also very dispersed. In such cases, smartphone technology provides tremendous support to the sharing economy.

### A more fair trade system
Many innovations can boost the agricultural production of small-scale farmers. However, in order to actually transform food systems, changes in trade systems are also needed.
Farmers in developing countries struggle when competing with subsidized products from developed countries.
Tariffs on agricultural products are common both in North-South, and South-South trade. This makes it even more difficult for developing countries to break the patterns of trade.

Fairtrade is an organisation with a label that signals that the producers and consumers have formed a partnership.
Better knowledge and green investments are exactly what small-scale farmers need in order to sustainably boost their production.

### Additional material: Agricultural Policies at a Glance
Production-linked measures, in particular, mask market signals, harm competitiveness, and can potentially lead to environmentally-damaging production systems. Moreover, such measures can be inequitable and inefficient, as the bulk of the benefits accrue to the largest producers or leak away to unintended beneficiaries in the upstream and downstream sectors or are capitalised in the value of fixed assets. The choice of policy instruments is therefore arguably as important as the level of support.

Policy effort needs to be directed to the development of a competitive, innovative agricultural sector that can respond to future needs. Agricultural policy needs to be coherent with policies in other areas – economic, social and environmental – and to reduce impediments to structural adjustment. This kind of approach will be more effective in most countries than the fine-tuning of existing agricultural policies.

policy makers should:
- Reduce the use of market price support with a view to its eventual elimination
- Move away from the use of input subsidies:  are strongly production-distorting, and increases the risk of environmental damage from over- or misuse of farm inputs
- Increase strategic public investments to enhance sustainable productivity growth
- Target public policies to address specific goals and intended beneficiaries
- Ensure that risk management policies focus on helping farmers to cope with unavoidable and unpredictable risks
- Improve the enabling environment for a business-oriented agricultural sector.

## 3. Transforming the big
- Explain the significance of global supply chains in agriculture
- Describe how it is possible to transform the present day industrialized farming systems

### Goal-based planning
Together with transport, agriculture was one of the major activities, that was not integrated into the quota system of the Kyoto Protocol. Thus, many of the initiatives directed towards a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions have not focused on agriculture. In Denmark, the agricultural sector is responsible for about 20% of the total Danish emissions of greenhouse gasses. Most of these emissions come from livestock, with 63% from cows and 32% from pig production. These staggering numbers are not primarily due to CO2-emissions from machinery but, instead, two other greenhouse gases: nitrous oxide and methane. Nitrous oxide has a greenhouse effect which is almost 300 times stronger than CO2, and it is released primarily from manure and fertilizers. The greenhouse effect of methane is 25 times stronger than CO2, and this gas is also emitted from manure. In addition, burps from ruminant, that is to say cud-chewing animals, such as cows and sheep, release methane to the atmosphere. Handling these different kinds of emissions is essential in order to achieve both the Paris Agreement on climate change and the SDGs.

#### livestock
Denmark, the livestock industry has set some ambitious goals for the future: Europe’s largest pork producer, Danish Crown, intends to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by half before 2030 and to become C02-neutral in 2050. At the same time, Scandinavia’s largest producer of dairy products, Arla, is aiming for a 30% emission reduction for every liter of milk in 2030 and an achievement of net zero emissions in 2050. Both companies acknowledge, that while they know how to get half of the way, the second half requires further technological progress, and they hope to be able to put pressure on their suppliers of machinery and robotics.

The massive use of antibiotics worldwide in agriculture encourages the development of multiresistant bacteria. In the US, for example, 80% of total antibiotic use is in agriculture. Today, around 700 thousand people die annually, from drug-resistant infections. Antibiotic use is linked to the development of drug resistence and is projected to increase in the future, especially in low- and middle-income countries. This excessive use of antibiotics is propelling us into a global health crisis, where the use of biocides in food systems - as disinfectants, as food and feed preservatives, or as decontaminants - is a major contributor. Some studies suggest, that by the year 2050, 10 million deaths every year will be due to antibiotic resistance. 
That would surpass cancer as a dominant cause of mortality worldwide. In Europe, the use of antibiotics in food production is on the way down.

Each year, the EU imports soybeans for 3,8 billion euros. These beans come primarily from the US and Brazil and many of them are used in the livestock industry.
In Brazil, this soy production is a major contributor to deforestation and destruction of important habitats for biodiversity. Only commodity driven deforestation for wood is a more central driver than shifting agriculture in this trend. Global Forest Watch estimates that from 2001 to 2017, Brazil has lost around 51 million hectares of tree cover. This is equivalent to 4,2 giga tons of CO2-emissions – the same amount of emissions as all airline flights in the world over a 5 year period.
A third of the entire Amazon is headed toward or has crossed a threshold of forest cover, which scientists believe accelerates biodiversity loss. The loss of known and unknown species from these reduced forest areas, can be up to four times faster than in less impacted forests. Thus, it can matter on the other side of the globe, what a Danish farmer feeds his pigs.

>  I think the best advice is to eat less meat but of better quality. That is good for the farmer and good for the consumer. ~ Danish Crown

#### dairy
The dairy producer, Arla, is confronting some of the same challenges as the meat industry. Manures is a common challenge for the meat and dairy industries. A common solution is biogas plants. These have become economically feasible through government subsidies and Danish biogas production doubled from 2014 to 2017. It now represents about 7% of all sustainable energy production in the country.

We believe we can reduce our CO2 impact significantly on the farms and in addition reduce methane emission from the cow even though we will never be able to fully remove it. In the future, both changes in the genetics of cows and technical solutions for carbon sequestration will be important for achieving Arla’s ambitions.

### Sustainable soils
Industrial scale agriculture suffers from yet another problem. Soil degradation. Declining soil quality is not just a problem in the global south. It is happening all around the world. In Europe, about 12,5% of arable land is estimated to suffer from moderate to high erosion. This is equal to an area larger than the entire area of Greece.

My name is Christian Bugge Henriksen. I'm associate professor and research group leader of the climate and food security group here at the University of Copenhagen. We are working on sustainable food systems, with a focus on food production, but also covering the entire food value chain.
We are also focusing on the transition towards less meat and more plant-based diets. I am currently involved in the Horizon 2020 project LANDMARK, and in this project, I'm leading the development of the soil navigator, which is a decision support tool for agriculture, for farmers and advisors, that will advise them in how to optimize their soil functions.

The drivers behind the issue are many. We are working on soil, because we are currently facing a number of threats to our soil resources. These threats include population growth, urban expansion, pollution, climate change and unsustainable management practices. All these threats are drivers of soil degradation.

Erosion is one of the central types of degradation. When the soil is eroded by either wind or water, it may lose 75% to 80% of its organic matter content, and also its nutrient content, with consequent release of carbon to the atmosphere. With lower carbon content, the soil will also lose its ability to hold and supply water for the plants. Another consequence can be a decrease in soil biodiversity. Heavy machinery can cause yet another type of soil degradation, as it compacts or seals the soil. Finally, acidification and soil pollution are additional contributors to soil degradation. All in all, the different types of soil degradation can impair the five basic functions of the soil: 
- `Primary productivity` is the capacity of the soil to provide food, fiber, feed and energy. 
- `Nutrient cycling` is the capacity of the soil to receive, store, supply and recycle nutrients. 
- `Water regulation and purification` is the capacity of the soil to remove harmful compounds from the soil and also to supply sufficient water for the crop use.
- `Habitat and biodiversity` is the capacity of the soil to provide a habitat for a wide range of soil organisms.
- The `carbon sequestration and climate regulation` function is the capacity of the soil to store carbon in a stable form, mainly as organic matter, and also to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions, including CO₂, nitrous oxide and methane.

The **Soil Navigator system** is built up around precisely these five functions. It will assist farmers and farmer advisors in maintaining long term sustainability and soil fertility. Whereas other agricultural decision support systems focused mainly on the yield and nutrient management - the Soil Navigator will work on all soil functions simultaneously with decision support models.

The first step is the input data, so the farmer will be able to see, for each of the soil functions, if they have a low, medium or high level. And based on this assessment, the farmer will then be able to decide in which functions to focus and get very specific recommendations

### Closed-system farming
In the Netherlands, the transformation is not shaping up as the sum of many small improvements. Here, researchers are going for the big leap.

At Wageningen University, Ernst van den Ende explains what it's all about: So we are now in our greenhouses, and what I really would like to show you is the way we try to optimize tomato growing under controlled conditions. One of the opportunities we have in controlled conditions, is that we can be very precise in the use of water, the use of fertilizers. We control the environment in such a way, that we also can use a lot of biological control agents to control pests in these crops. That makes tomato growing in greenhouse conditions really a champion in circular agriculture.

Because we try to optimize everything, we try to reduce the waste streams and in that way we are able to grow a lot of tomatoes per square meters in a very sustainable way. Just to give you an example, if you grow tomatoes in an open field situation in Spain, you will end up with four kilograms of tomatoes per square meter, at the end of the growing season. If you grow tomatoes under such conditions, you will end up with eighty kilograms per square meter after one growing season, which is twenty times more. But the best part of the story is that we do that with four times less water and that we do that fully under biological control, which means that although we produce more we use less inputs. That again is of course a very important part of sustainable development.

Although the Netherlands is a small, densely populated country, with more than 488 inhabitants per square kilometer, they have the second largest export of food in the world, measured by value. Only the United States earns more money from food export, and they have a landmass, which is 270 times larger than the Netherlands. One aspect of this multifaceted agricultural approach in the Netherlands is the use of LED lights.

nowadays we use a lot of LED lightning in the production of vegetables and flowers under glass. With these LED lights you can really influence, not only the growth of plants, but for instance also the resistance against pests. You can really lower the amount of pesticides that you use in the growing of plants in greenhouses. Another aspect of these LED lights is that we can also influence the quality of the product. So we have examples where we double the amount of vitamin C in tomatoes, with red LED lights. Precision farming under controlled conditions entails a more individualized way of taking care of plants.

We have no emissions from nitrogen or any other fertilizers. And you really try to come up with the perfect fertilization for each plant. 
The emergence of precision farming is not limited to indoor farming, as the development of new types of sensors and data processing is happening across the field.

So one of the very important strategic themes for the future, is digital agriculture and precision agriculture.
So, in the open field situation we work with robots and drones, to really optimize the censoring, looking for possibilities to reduce the amount of labor, with robots. Within the greenhouses, we started to use a lot of sensors in order to phenotype plants, during the whole day - 24 hours a day. Then we collect an awful lot of data and later on, we can use these data in greenhouses that are using artificial intelligence to grow your crops.
Machine learning in the cultivation of plants, is yet another example of how future food systems will be managed by trends, that are emerging today.

GMOs are plants that have been altered through laboratory changes in the genetic material of the plants. Primarily, the use of genetic modification in plants, has so far been to increase insect resistance and herbicide tolerance. So the use of GMOs in agriculture has to a high degree been associated with supporting systems of unsustainable, highly industrialized mono-crop culturing systems. In the United States, more than 93% of the corn and soy planted is genetically modified in some way.
Worldwide areas with genetically modified crops have been expanding since it became commercially viable two decades ago, but over the last decade this growth has stalled and in 2015 there was the first ever drop in genetically modified acreage globally. This is partly due to American saturation, and partly due to public resistance. In Europe especially, genetically modified products are a hard sell, as consumers prefer to buy food with labels stating that they are 'GMO free'. This is often due to a perception, that GMOs are unnatural.

CRISPR is a new and more effective method of doing genome editing. Critics say that CRISPR represents uncharted territory and should only be used with extreme caution, as there has been too little time to study the potential side effects and consequences of its use. Now, it is possible to alter just a single DNA letter at a specific place in the genome with CRISPR.  It will not be the golden bullet to feed the world in 2050, but it will certainly be a part of that, and if we can use this technology, we will speed up plant breeding, we will be more precise in creating for instance resistant cultivars or protocols that are more tolerant to abiotic stess, like drought, and as we all know with the climate change and with the enormous pressure on pesticides, there is a strong need to come up very fast with new cultivars that can meet these different demands, I'm talking about. I think, therefore we should really work with science and public together to judge the technology, to make people aware of the opportunities of this technology, and to see whether we can use it in the future.

A niche under greenhouse production is vertical farming. The demand for the vertical farming is mainly coming from areas, which are very much urbanized. It will often be based on hydroponics, aquaponics or aeroponics - the methods, where plants are grown without soil.
The advantage of those systems is that you can exactly control how much growth there is of the plant, every day of the year - independent of the outside climate - and that you can control its climate.

Worldwide scarcity of water is a very big issue, and then if you think about for instance, vegetables grown in the open field in the Mediterranean, even if you have a lot of technology you will need at least 60 liters of water per kilogram of vegetable. If you grow in a Dutch greenhouse, that's usually already soilless, we use about 16 liters of water per kilogram vegetables. So you go down from 60 liters to 16. In these vertical farming systems you can go even much further down, if we recollect the transpired water of the plant. The plants transpire a lot water vapour. That water vapour can be regained and well, then you can go down the water use to just a few liters of water per kilogram vegetables.

Advantages of this vertical farming is: very high production rate you don't need much land area, so that also means that you need less land area for food production, you can give that land back, for instance to nature. We need very little of water, very little nutrients, if we keep all the pests out, we don't need pesticides to control them. So that makes it on many sustainability criteria very good. Are there also some less good points? Well, it is still quite expensive and it uses a lot of electricity, in particular for the lamps, and that also partly relates it to why it is still expensive. 
we expect that it will get cheaper in the coming years and that's what we are working on in our research.

Attribution of CO2 emissions from Brazilian deforestation to consumers between 1990 and 2010
- Jonas Karstensen, Glen P Peters and Robbie M Andrew
- Center for International Climate and Environmental Research—Oslo (CICERO), Norway
- Published 4 April 2013

#### Abstract
Efforts to reduce deforestation to mitigate climate change and to conserve biodiversity are taking place on a global scale. While many studies have estimated the emissions occurring from deforestation, few studies have quantified the domestic and international drivers sustaining deforestation rates. In this study we establish the link between Brazilian deforestation and production of cattle and soybeans, and allocate emissions between 1990 and 2010 along the global supply chain to the countries that consume products dependent on Brazilian deforestation. We find that 30% of the carbon emissions associated with deforestation were exported from Brazil in the last decade, of which 29% were due to soybean production and 71% cattle ranching. The share exported is growing, with industrialized nations and emerging markets (especially Russia and China) greatly increasing imports. We find a correlation between exports (and hence global consumption) of Brazilian cattle and soybeans and emissions from deforestation. We conclude that trade is emerging as a key driver of deforestation in Brazil, and this may indirectly contribute to loss of the forests that industrialized countries are seeking to protect through international agreements.

#### 1. Introduction
Global CO2 emissions rose nearly 50% over the last two decades, and estimates suggest land-use change (LUC) was one of the largest individual sources, contributing approximately 15% between 1990 and 2010. High emissions from LUC mostly occur in the tropical regions, where forest carbon density is highest. Forest loss releases carbon stored in biomass and soil to the atmosphere, increasing radiative forcing and temperature changes on a global scale. 
Reducing tropical deforestation is desirable, not only because it might be one of the cheapest options to effectively reduce global CO2 emissions, but also because it would enhance sinks and protect valuable ecosystems. Linking deforestation and its associated emissions to agricultural production and international trade can reveal the global socio-economic drivers leading to domestic and international production and consumption.

### Additional material: Overview over global agricultural land use
Agriculture is a major use of land. Half of the world’s habitable land is used for agriculture. The extensive land use has a major impact on the earth’s environment as it reduces wilderness and threatens biodiversity.

Reducing the consumption of resource-intensive products and increasing the productivity of land makes it possible to produce food with much smaller inputs and reducing the impact on the environment.

#### Half of the world’s habitable land is used for agriculture
There is a highly unequal distribution of land use between livestock and crops for human consumption. If we combine pastures used for grazing with land used to grow crops for animal feed, livestock accounts for 77% of global farming land. While livestock takes up most of the world’s agricultural land it only produces 18% of the world’s calories and 37% of total protein.

The expansion of agriculture has been one of humanity’s largest impacts on the environment. It has transformed habitats and is one of the greatest pressures for biodiversity: of the 28,000 species evaluated to be threatened with extinction on the IUCN Red List, agriculture is listed as a threat for 24,000 of them. But we also know that we can reduce these impacts – both through dietary changes, by substituting some meat with plant-based alternatives and through technology advances. Crop yields have increased significantly in recent decades, meaning we have spared a lot of land from agricultural production: globally, to produce the same amount of crops as in 1961, we need only 30% of the farmland.

With solutions from both consumers and producers, we have an important opportunity to restore some of this farmland back to forests and natural habitats.

#### Definitions of agricultural land use
The Land Area of the World is 13,003 million ha. 4,889 million ha are classified as ‘agricultural area’ by the FAO (this is 37.6% of the Land Area).

The agricultural area use is divided into 3 categories: arable land (28% of the global agricultural area), permanent crops (3%) and permanent meadows and pastures (69%) which account for the largest share of the world’s agricultural area.6

What do these words mean?

The agricultural area is the sum of arable land, permanent crops, permanent meadows and pastures.

The FAO definition for arable land is land under temporary agricultural crops (multiple-cropped areas are counted only once), temporary meadows for mowing or pasture, land under market and kitchen gardens and land temporarily fallow (less than five years). The abandoned land resulting from shifting cultivation is not included in this category. Data for “Arable land” are not meant to indicate the amount of land that is potentially cultivable.

The same source defines permanent crops as follows: ‘Permanent crops are divided into temporary and permanent crops. Permanent crops are sown or planted once, and then occupy the land for some years and need not be replanted after each annual harvest, such as cocoa, coffee and rubber. This category includes flowering shrubs, fruit trees, nut trees and vines, but excludes trees grown for wood or timber. And again from the same source the definition for permanent meadows and pastures is ‘land used permanently (five years or more) to grow herbaceous forage crops, either cultivated or growing wild (wild prairie or grazing land).’

The FAO definition for fallow land is ‘the cultivated land that is not seeded for one or more growing seasons. The maximum idle period is usually less than five years.’
