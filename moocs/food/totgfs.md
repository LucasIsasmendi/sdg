## 1. Introduction to the Global Food System
### Transformation of the global food system - Introduction
We must accept that we are part of a bigger system and without addressing the full implications of our actions, sustainable development of our society is impossible to achieve.

My name is Katherine Richardson. Back in 2009, I was part of a research team that presented the so-called **"planetary boundaries"**. Science tells us that humans impact the Earth at the global level. With the planetary boundaries, we are trying to examine how much we can let our activities impact the Earth System without running the risk of our impact leading to drastic changes in the conditions we experience on Earth.

We identify nine processes in the Earth System where our impacts could potentially lead to a change in the overall Earth conditions. Impact levels from [0] to [5]:
 - `Climate change` [2]
 - Novel entities [3+]
 - Stratopheric ozone depletion [0+]
 - Atmospheric aerosol loading [3+]
 - Ocean Acidification [1+]
 - `Biochemical flows`
   - Phosporous [4]
   - Nitrogen [5]
- Freshwater use [0+]
- `Land-system change` [3]
- `Biosphere integrity`
  - Functional diversity [3+]
  - Genetic diversity [5]

For four of these, Climate change, Biochemical flows, Land-system change and Biosphere integrity, our studies suggest that we have moved out of the safe operating space. In other words, our impact on these processes is already so great that it increases the risk of dramatic changes in the conditions we experience on Earth. 

Recognizing that our activities impact the Earth at the global level makes it painfully clear the need for changing the way we do many things. We need to ensure that the value society obtains from our activities comes with a minimal environmental cost.

Making sure that our demand for the Earth's resources is held to within the supply of these resources is, however, only half of the sustainability challenge. Kate Raworth, an economist at Oxford, describes the second half of the challenge. Kate identifies a doughnut-shaped space where sustainable development can occur. The outer ring on the doughnut is determined by the planetary boundaries. The inner ring by the need to secure a minimum standard of living for all human beings.
With regard to food, the two sides of the sustainability challenge are abundantly clear. On the one hand, more than 800 million people globally are chronically undernourished, while on the other, our food systems are releasing about a third of all greenhouse gases. They are also responsible for about 80% of our loss of biodiversity. Therefore, scaling up food systems as we know them today is simply not an option if we are to feed a world population that is expected to be at nine to ten billion in 2050.

> **What is needed within our global food systems then is not an upscaling, but a transformation.**

Starting with a production focus and moving towards the consumer, four vital parts of this transformation can be identified: 
1. Boosting the small
2. Tansforming the big
3. Losing less
4. Eating smarter.

New technology is not enough. Government intervention will be required, as will improved finance and behavioral change from both citizens and consumers. 
As young protesters cry across the globe: There is no planet B!

### TED talk (Video): Kate Raworth – A healthy economy should be designed to thrive, not grow

[TED talk link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rhcrbcg8HBw)

At country level, we are obsessed with growth GDP (since was invented in 1930) and mass consumption.
- We are financially addicted to gowth because today's financial system is designed to pursue the highest rate of monetary return.
- We are politically addicted to gowth because politicians want to raise tax revenue without raising taxes and a growing GDP is the way to do that
- We are socially addicted to gowth because thanks to a century of consumer propaganda, which fascinatingly was created by Edward Bernays the nephew of Sigmun Freud. He created a very lucrative retail therapy, make us believe that we transform ourselves every time we buy something more.

Global GDP is 10x bigger than it was in 1950, which has brought prosperity to billions of people. Bit the global economy has also become incredibly diviside, with the vast share of returns to wealth now ocurring to a fraction of the global 1%. And the economy has become incredibly degenerative, rapidly destabilizing this delicately balanced planet.

**doughnut framework**: We cannot let our collective resource use overshoot that outer circle, the ecological ceiling. Is a dynamic balance. We are far from balance right now: falling short and overshooting at the same time.
This is our selfie, we the people of 21st century. No economist from last century saw this picture, so why would we imagine that their theories would be up for taking on its challenges?
**We need ideas of our own, because we are the first generation to see this and probably the last with a real chance of turning this story around**

More gowth won't clean things up again.

We need to create economies that tackle this shortfall and overshoot together, by design. **We need economies that are REGENERATIVE and DISTRIBUTIVE by design.**
We have inherited degenerative industries: `TAKE(from planet) -> MAKE -> USE  -> LOSE`

We need to `REGENERATE` biological materials and `RESTORE` technical materials and avoid `TAKE`. Where waste from one process is food for the next.

This century we can design our technologies and institutions to distribute wealth,knowledge and empowerment to many. 

**When something tries to grows forever within a healthy, living, thriving system, it's a threat to the health of the whole.**

Focus on thriving and balance, within the social and the ecological boundaries of the doughnut. The world's most ingenious people turn boundaries into the source of their creativity. It's boundaries that unleash our potential. 

### The food system and its links
- How are each of the Earth System components, which are depicted and conceptualized through the planetary boundaries (see figure below), connected to our food systems? (read Campbell et al. 2017)

<img src="../food/img/totgfs-1.2-agriculture%20and%20planetary%20boundaries.png" width="50%">

Why won’t new technologies alone solve the challenges in front of us? (Hints: Think, for example, of biodiversity loss and [Jevon’s Paradox](#jevons-paradox))

## 2. Boosting the Small
### Increasing know-how
The story of our current food system begins in Nigeria, Africa. By 2050 the world has to feed an additional 2 billion people, and it is here, in Africa, that most of them will live.
Smallholder farmers, that means farmers with only a couple of hectares of land, are key to feeding future populations. In 2030, it is expected there will be 750 million of these smallholder farmers worldwide.
As a start, these farmers need more knowledge concerning best practice, both because the knowledge can increase output, but also because it can contribute to improved land management.
Best practices are the small simple steps, that can make a huge impact, when looking at the overall agricultural yield of Africa. These are small skills and techniques, that farmers apply to increase the yield of their crops. It is either around the right spacing for crops, the right time to apply fertilizers or herbicides or fungicides. It is around how and where to get the right seed,

### Natural nitrogen fixation
A major challenge, facing the farmers in Africa in their daily work, is getting access to nitrogen to support plant growth.

Access to nitrogen is a double-edged sword in terms of sustainable development. Too much on your soils is a bad thing, as it causes contamination of groundwater, eutrophication of freshwater and estuarine ecosystems, atmospheric pollution and soil acidification as well as soil degradation. On the flip side, too little nitrogen results in low production yields, soil nutrient mining and soil degradation. All of these consequences lead to poor human nutrition.

Ken Giller has specialized in putting the plants that can fix nitrogen to use for small-scale farmers in Africa. These plants are called legumes: peas and beans. They provide protein, minerals, particularly for people in their diets.
They are very good in terms of the fact that they fix nitrogen from the air. 
The bacteria Rhizobium is what inyects nitrogen. So seed and bacterium needs to go togheter. By ussing legumes, smallholder farmers can boost their production with less amounts of fertilizers. Legumes are often grown with maize.
Efficient use of nitrogen fertilizers is also important in Africa.

### Better access to finance
In Costa Rica, the major obstacle for many small- and medium-sized farms is finance. Loans and investments are important for a farmer to conduct her business. But in many rural areas, interest rates for microcredit are around 35% per year.

Through public-private partnerships, public funds can be made available to support an innovative private sector, with the right experience and the knowledge to make changes in the food system.

Tips:
- tailor finance programmes to the specific needs of different farmers
- adjust the conditions of payment, period of grace, the type of guarantee depending on the project.
- follow up and support in the transformations that have to be made
- create good results: better income, less environmental impact and greater social impact on the community

### Sharing economy
Hello Tractor: rent a tractor for a period of time. For farmers with average 1,8 to 3 hectares. Usually a farmer starts to get mechanized around 5 hectares, but Hello Tractor is opening up the opportunity to receive mechanization, even when you're below that level.
Mechanization is so crucial in the crop production cycle for farmers. It has the ability to really increase and impact the yields of the farmers and their revenue in so many ways. The ability to plant 40 time faster with mechanization than manual labor. Their ability to increase up to 40% their revenue stream. And it's really, at the core, an opportunity for them to reach their potential revenue and by relying on agriculture to improve food security - because *Africa has the biggest arable land available today on Earth*.

Hello Tractor depends on booking agents. These agents are specialized farmers, who speak English fluently and possess a smartphone. When a farmer wants a tractor service he goes to our booking agents. Basically, the booking agent role is to mitigate the fact, that farmers don't necessarily use Android phones and smartphones. So they place the orders on their behalf.

In vast countries like Nigeria, where the population is very dispersed, demand for mechanized equipment is also very dispersed. In such cases, smartphone technology provides tremendous support to the sharing economy.

### A more fair trade system
Many innovations can boost the agricultural production of small-scale farmers. However, in order to actually transform food systems, changes in trade systems are also needed.
Farmers in developing countries struggle when competing with subsidized products from developed countries.
Tariffs on agricultural products are common both in North-South, and South-South trade. This makes it even more difficult for developing countries to break the patterns of trade.

Fairtrade is an organisation with a label that signals that the producers and consumers have formed a partnership.
Better knowledge and green investments are exactly what small-scale farmers need in order to sustainably boost their production.

### Additional material: Agricultural Policies at a Glance
Production-linked measures, in particular, mask market signals, harm competitiveness, and can potentially lead to environmentally-damaging production systems. Moreover, such measures can be inequitable and inefficient, as the bulk of the benefits accrue to the largest producers or leak away to unintended beneficiaries in the upstream and downstream sectors or are capitalised in the value of fixed assets. The choice of policy instruments is therefore arguably as important as the level of support.

Policy effort needs to be directed to the development of a competitive, innovative agricultural sector that can respond to future needs. Agricultural policy needs to be coherent with policies in other areas – economic, social and environmental – and to reduce impediments to structural adjustment. This kind of approach will be more effective in most countries than the fine-tuning of existing agricultural policies.

policy makers should:
- Reduce the use of market price support with a view to its eventual elimination
- Move away from the use of input subsidies:  are strongly production-distorting, and increases the risk of environmental damage from over- or misuse of farm inputs
- Increase strategic public investments to enhance sustainable productivity growth
- Target public policies to address specific goals and intended beneficiaries
- Ensure that risk management policies focus on helping farmers to cope with unavoidable and unpredictable risks
- Improve the enabling environment for a business-oriented agricultural sector.

## 3. Transforming the big
- Explain the significance of global supply chains in agriculture
- Describe how it is possible to transform the present day industrialized farming systems

### Goal-based planning
Together with transport, agriculture was one of the major activities, that was not integrated into the quota system of the Kyoto Protocol. Thus, many of the initiatives directed towards a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions have not focused on agriculture. In Denmark, the agricultural sector is responsible for about 20% of the total Danish emissions of greenhouse gasses. Most of these emissions come from livestock, with 63% from cows and 32% from pig production. These staggering numbers are not primarily due to CO2-emissions from machinery but, instead, two other greenhouse gases: nitrous oxide and methane. Nitrous oxide has a greenhouse effect which is almost 300 times stronger than CO2, and it is released primarily from manure and fertilizers. The greenhouse effect of methane is 25 times stronger than CO2, and this gas is also emitted from manure. In addition, burps from ruminant, that is to say cud-chewing animals, such as cows and sheep, release methane to the atmosphere. Handling these different kinds of emissions is essential in order to achieve both the Paris Agreement on climate change and the SDGs.

#### livestock
Denmark, the livestock industry has set some ambitious goals for the future: Europe’s largest pork producer, Danish Crown, intends to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by half before 2030 and to become C02-neutral in 2050. At the same time, Scandinavia’s largest producer of dairy products, Arla, is aiming for a 30% emission reduction for every liter of milk in 2030 and an achievement of net zero emissions in 2050. Both companies acknowledge, that while they know how to get half of the way, the second half requires further technological progress, and they hope to be able to put pressure on their suppliers of machinery and robotics.

The massive use of antibiotics worldwide in agriculture encourages the development of multiresistant bacteria. In the US, for example, 80% of total antibiotic use is in agriculture. Today, around 700 thousand people die annually, from drug-resistant infections. Antibiotic use is linked to the development of drug resistence and is projected to increase in the future, especially in low- and middle-income countries. This excessive use of antibiotics is propelling us into a global health crisis, where the use of biocides in food systems - as disinfectants, as food and feed preservatives, or as decontaminants - is a major contributor. Some studies suggest, that by the year 2050, 10 million deaths every year will be due to antibiotic resistance. 
That would surpass cancer as a dominant cause of mortality worldwide. In Europe, the use of antibiotics in food production is on the way down.

Each year, the EU imports soybeans for 3,8 billion euros. These beans come primarily from the US and Brazil and many of them are used in the livestock industry.
In Brazil, this soy production is a major contributor to deforestation and destruction of important habitats for biodiversity. Only commodity driven deforestation for wood is a more central driver than shifting agriculture in this trend. Global Forest Watch estimates that from 2001 to 2017, Brazil has lost around 51 million hectares of tree cover. This is equivalent to 4,2 giga tons of CO2-emissions – the same amount of emissions as all airline flights in the world over a 5 year period.
A third of the entire Amazon is headed toward or has crossed a threshold of forest cover, which scientists believe accelerates biodiversity loss. The loss of known and unknown species from these reduced forest areas, can be up to four times faster than in less impacted forests. Thus, it can matter on the other side of the globe, what a Danish farmer feeds his pigs.

>  I think the best advice is to eat less meat but of better quality. That is good for the farmer and good for the consumer. ~ Danish Crown

#### dairy
The dairy producer, Arla, is confronting some of the same challenges as the meat industry. Manures is a common challenge for the meat and dairy industries. A common solution is biogas plants. These have become economically feasible through government subsidies and Danish biogas production doubled from 2014 to 2017. It now represents about 7% of all sustainable energy production in the country.

We believe we can reduce our CO2 impact significantly on the farms and in addition reduce methane emission from the cow even though we will never be able to fully remove it. In the future, both changes in the genetics of cows and technical solutions for carbon sequestration will be important for achieving Arla’s ambitions.

### Sustainable soils
Industrial scale agriculture suffers from yet another problem. Soil degradation. Declining soil quality is not just a problem in the global south. It is happening all around the world. In Europe, about 12,5% of arable land is estimated to suffer from moderate to high erosion. This is equal to an area larger than the entire area of Greece.

My name is Christian Bugge Henriksen. I'm associate professor and research group leader of the climate and food security group here at the University of Copenhagen. We are working on sustainable food systems, with a focus on food production, but also covering the entire food value chain.
We are also focusing on the transition towards less meat and more plant-based diets. I am currently involved in the Horizon 2020 project LANDMARK, and in this project, I'm leading the development of the soil navigator, which is a decision support tool for agriculture, for farmers and advisors, that will advise them in how to optimize their soil functions.

The drivers behind the issue are many. We are working on soil, because we are currently facing a number of threats to our soil resources. These threats include population growth, urban expansion, pollution, climate change and unsustainable management practices. All these threats are drivers of soil degradation.

Erosion is one of the central types of degradation. When the soil is eroded by either wind or water, it may lose 75% to 80% of its organic matter content, and also its nutrient content, with consequent release of carbon to the atmosphere. With lower carbon content, the soil will also lose its ability to hold and supply water for the plants. Another consequence can be a decrease in soil biodiversity. Heavy machinery can cause yet another type of soil degradation, as it compacts or seals the soil. Finally, acidification and soil pollution are additional contributors to soil degradation. All in all, the different types of soil degradation can impair the five basic functions of the soil: 
- `Primary productivity` is the capacity of the soil to provide food, fiber, feed and energy. 
- `Nutrient cycling` is the capacity of the soil to receive, store, supply and recycle nutrients. 
- `Water regulation and purification` is the capacity of the soil to remove harmful compounds from the soil and also to supply sufficient water for the crop use.
- `Habitat and biodiversity` is the capacity of the soil to provide a habitat for a wide range of soil organisms.
- The `carbon sequestration and climate regulation` function is the capacity of the soil to store carbon in a stable form, mainly as organic matter, and also to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions, including CO₂, nitrous oxide and methane.

The **Soil Navigator system** is built up around precisely these five functions. It will assist farmers and farmer advisors in maintaining long term sustainability and soil fertility. Whereas other agricultural decision support systems focused mainly on the yield and nutrient management - the Soil Navigator will work on all soil functions simultaneously with decision support models.

The first step is the input data, so the farmer will be able to see, for each of the soil functions, if they have a low, medium or high level. And based on this assessment, the farmer will then be able to decide in which functions to focus and get very specific recommendations

### Closed-system farming
In the Netherlands, the transformation is not shaping up as the sum of many small improvements. Here, researchers are going for the big leap.

At Wageningen University, Ernst van den Ende explains what it's all about: So we are now in our greenhouses, and what I really would like to show you is the way we try to optimize tomato growing under controlled conditions. One of the opportunities we have in controlled conditions, is that we can be very precise in the use of water, the use of fertilizers. We control the environment in such a way, that we also can use a lot of biological control agents to control pests in these crops. That makes tomato growing in greenhouse conditions really a champion in circular agriculture.

Because we try to optimize everything, we try to reduce the waste streams and in that way we are able to grow a lot of tomatoes per square meters in a very sustainable way. Just to give you an example, if you grow tomatoes in an open field situation in Spain, you will end up with four kilograms of tomatoes per square meter, at the end of the growing season. If you grow tomatoes under such conditions, you will end up with eighty kilograms per square meter after one growing season, which is twenty times more. But the best part of the story is that we do that with four times less water and that we do that fully under biological control, which means that although we produce more we use less inputs. That again is of course a very important part of sustainable development.

Although the Netherlands is a small, densely populated country, with more than 488 inhabitants per square kilometer, they have the second largest export of food in the world, measured by value. Only the United States earns more money from food export, and they have a landmass, which is 270 times larger than the Netherlands. One aspect of this multifaceted agricultural approach in the Netherlands is the use of LED lights.

nowadays we use a lot of LED lightning in the production of vegetables and flowers under glass. With these LED lights you can really influence, not only the growth of plants, but for instance also the resistance against pests. You can really lower the amount of pesticides that you use in the growing of plants in greenhouses. Another aspect of these LED lights is that we can also influence the quality of the product. So we have examples where we double the amount of vitamin C in tomatoes, with red LED lights. Precision farming under controlled conditions entails a more individualized way of taking care of plants.

We have no emissions from nitrogen or any other fertilizers. And you really try to come up with the perfect fertilization for each plant. 
The emergence of precision farming is not limited to indoor farming, as the development of new types of sensors and data processing is happening across the field.

So one of the very important strategic themes for the future, is digital agriculture and precision agriculture.
So, in the open field situation we work with robots and drones, to really optimize the censoring, looking for possibilities to reduce the amount of labor, with robots. Within the greenhouses, we started to use a lot of sensors in order to phenotype plants, during the whole day - 24 hours a day. Then we collect an awful lot of data and later on, we can use these data in greenhouses that are using artificial intelligence to grow your crops.
Machine learning in the cultivation of plants, is yet another example of how future food systems will be managed by trends, that are emerging today.

GMOs are plants that have been altered through laboratory changes in the genetic material of the plants. Primarily, the use of genetic modification in plants, has so far been to increase insect resistance and herbicide tolerance. So the use of GMOs in agriculture has to a high degree been associated with supporting systems of unsustainable, highly industrialized mono-crop culturing systems. In the United States, more than 93% of the corn and soy planted is genetically modified in some way.
Worldwide areas with genetically modified crops have been expanding since it became commercially viable two decades ago, but over the last decade this growth has stalled and in 2015 there was the first ever drop in genetically modified acreage globally. This is partly due to American saturation, and partly due to public resistance. In Europe especially, genetically modified products are a hard sell, as consumers prefer to buy food with labels stating that they are 'GMO free'. This is often due to a perception, that GMOs are unnatural.

CRISPR is a new and more effective method of doing genome editing. Critics say that CRISPR represents uncharted territory and should only be used with extreme caution, as there has been too little time to study the potential side effects and consequences of its use. Now, it is possible to alter just a single DNA letter at a specific place in the genome with CRISPR.  It will not be the golden bullet to feed the world in 2050, but it will certainly be a part of that, and if we can use this technology, we will speed up plant breeding, we will be more precise in creating for instance resistant cultivars or protocols that are more tolerant to abiotic stess, like drought, and as we all know with the climate change and with the enormous pressure on pesticides, there is a strong need to come up very fast with new cultivars that can meet these different demands, I'm talking about. I think, therefore we should really work with science and public together to judge the technology, to make people aware of the opportunities of this technology, and to see whether we can use it in the future.

A niche under greenhouse production is vertical farming. The demand for the vertical farming is mainly coming from areas, which are very much urbanized. It will often be based on hydroponics, aquaponics or aeroponics - the methods, where plants are grown without soil.
The advantage of those systems is that you can exactly control how much growth there is of the plant, every day of the year - independent of the outside climate - and that you can control its climate.

Worldwide scarcity of water is a very big issue, and then if you think about for instance, vegetables grown in the open field in the Mediterranean, even if you have a lot of technology you will need at least 60 liters of water per kilogram of vegetable. If you grow in a Dutch greenhouse, that's usually already soilless, we use about 16 liters of water per kilogram vegetables. So you go down from 60 liters to 16. In these vertical farming systems you can go even much further down, if we recollect the transpired water of the plant. The plants transpire a lot water vapour. That water vapour can be regained and well, then you can go down the water use to just a few liters of water per kilogram vegetables.

Advantages of this vertical farming is: very high production rate you don't need much land area, so that also means that you need less land area for food production, you can give that land back, for instance to nature. We need very little of water, very little nutrients, if we keep all the pests out, we don't need pesticides to control them. So that makes it on many sustainability criteria very good. Are there also some less good points? Well, it is still quite expensive and it uses a lot of electricity, in particular for the lamps, and that also partly relates it to why it is still expensive. 
we expect that it will get cheaper in the coming years and that's what we are working on in our research.

Attribution of CO2 emissions from Brazilian deforestation to consumers between 1990 and 2010
- Jonas Karstensen, Glen P Peters and Robbie M Andrew
- Center for International Climate and Environmental Research—Oslo (CICERO), Norway
- Published 4 April 2013

#### Abstract
Efforts to reduce deforestation to mitigate climate change and to conserve biodiversity are taking place on a global scale. While many studies have estimated the emissions occurring from deforestation, few studies have quantified the domestic and international drivers sustaining deforestation rates. In this study we establish the link between Brazilian deforestation and production of cattle and soybeans, and allocate emissions between 1990 and 2010 along the global supply chain to the countries that consume products dependent on Brazilian deforestation. We find that 30% of the carbon emissions associated with deforestation were exported from Brazil in the last decade, of which 29% were due to soybean production and 71% cattle ranching. The share exported is growing, with industrialized nations and emerging markets (especially Russia and China) greatly increasing imports. We find a correlation between exports (and hence global consumption) of Brazilian cattle and soybeans and emissions from deforestation. We conclude that trade is emerging as a key driver of deforestation in Brazil, and this may indirectly contribute to loss of the forests that industrialized countries are seeking to protect through international agreements.

#### 1. Introduction
Global CO2 emissions rose nearly 50% over the last two decades, and estimates suggest land-use change (LUC) was one of the largest individual sources, contributing approximately 15% between 1990 and 2010. High emissions from LUC mostly occur in the tropical regions, where forest carbon density is highest. Forest loss releases carbon stored in biomass and soil to the atmosphere, increasing radiative forcing and temperature changes on a global scale. 
Reducing tropical deforestation is desirable, not only because it might be one of the cheapest options to effectively reduce global CO2 emissions, but also because it would enhance sinks and protect valuable ecosystems. Linking deforestation and its associated emissions to agricultural production and international trade can reveal the global socio-economic drivers leading to domestic and international production and consumption.

### Additional material: Overview over global agricultural land use
Agriculture is a major use of land. Half of the world’s habitable land is used for agriculture. The extensive land use has a major impact on the earth’s environment as it reduces wilderness and threatens biodiversity.

Reducing the consumption of resource-intensive products and increasing the productivity of land makes it possible to produce food with much smaller inputs and reducing the impact on the environment.

#### Half of the world’s habitable land is used for agriculture
There is a highly unequal distribution of land use between livestock and crops for human consumption. If we combine pastures used for grazing with land used to grow crops for animal feed, livestock accounts for 77% of global farming land. While livestock takes up most of the world’s agricultural land it only produces 18% of the world’s calories and 37% of total protein.

The expansion of agriculture has been one of humanity’s largest impacts on the environment. It has transformed habitats and is one of the greatest pressures for biodiversity: of the 28,000 species evaluated to be threatened with extinction on the IUCN Red List, agriculture is listed as a threat for 24,000 of them. But we also know that we can reduce these impacts – both through dietary changes, by substituting some meat with plant-based alternatives and through technology advances. Crop yields have increased significantly in recent decades, meaning we have spared a lot of land from agricultural production: globally, to produce the same amount of crops as in 1961, we need only 30% of the farmland.

With solutions from both consumers and producers, we have an important opportunity to restore some of this farmland back to forests and natural habitats.

#### Definitions of agricultural land use
The Land Area of the World is 13,003 million ha. 4,889 million ha are classified as ‘agricultural area’ by the FAO (this is 37.6% of the Land Area).

The agricultural area use is divided into 3 categories: arable land (28% of the global agricultural area), permanent crops (3%) and permanent meadows and pastures (69%) which account for the largest share of the world’s agricultural area.6

What do these words mean?

The agricultural area is the sum of arable land, permanent crops, permanent meadows and pastures.

The FAO definition for arable land is land under temporary agricultural crops (multiple-cropped areas are counted only once), temporary meadows for mowing or pasture, land under market and kitchen gardens and land temporarily fallow (less than five years). The abandoned land resulting from shifting cultivation is not included in this category. Data for “Arable land” are not meant to indicate the amount of land that is potentially cultivable.

The same source defines permanent crops as follows: ‘Permanent crops are divided into temporary and permanent crops. Permanent crops are sown or planted once, and then occupy the land for some years and need not be replanted after each annual harvest, such as cocoa, coffee and rubber. This category includes flowering shrubs, fruit trees, nut trees and vines, but excludes trees grown for wood or timber. And again from the same source the definition for permanent meadows and pastures is ‘land used permanently (five years or more) to grow herbaceous forage crops, either cultivated or growing wild (wild prairie or grazing land).’

The FAO definition for fallow land is ‘the cultivated land that is not seeded for one or more growing seasons. The maximum idle period is usually less than five years.’

## 4. Losing less
- Explain why we don’t necessarily have to produce 50% more food globally in 2050 to feed the larger population
- Describe where food is lost and wasted across the value chain

### Transport and storage
Often, when considering how the world can feed the nine to ten billion people we expect to be here in 2050, we hear that we will need to increase our global food production by 50%. This statistic is repeated regularly by big agro-businesses, as they seek to justify an ever expanding growth and production. While the challenge is clear, the narrative that 'we must feed the world', wrongly legitimizes current production practices. The narrative fails to address the fact, that feeding a world population of nine to ten billion, is also a question of the distribution of production and consumption - a matter of ensuring access of nutritional foods to all. Today, half of the commercial seed market is controlled by three companies. Four firms control up to 90% of the global grain trade. And seven companies control 100% of fertilizer sales.

Big scale advantages are arguably good for increasing production, but they can also be problematic with respect to the challenge of ensuring access to nutritional foods for all.
Food production today is already high, but one-third of all food produced is either lost or wasted. To put this in economic terms, food loss and waste causes as much as 940 billion dollars of economic losses every year.
Losing less is key to meeting the demands of a growing population, while turning our production in a more sustainable direction.
Food loss and waste is a global issue, but while it is present in all parts of the world, the concrete challenges are regionally specific. In Nigeria, Nnaemeka Ikegwuonu describes how better transportation and storage is vital: ColdHubs is one of Nnaemekas companies, and they are working in a simple, but effective way to limit food loss with 100% solar-powered working cold rooms situated in farms and market places. The goal is to use them to store food for as much as 21 days

### Connecting producers and consumers
The issue of food loss is not just a question of technological advancement but also improvement of the connection between producers and consumers. In Costa Rica, the government is very aware of strengthening this connection as some commodities today suffer from value chains with up to seven links between producer and consumer.

Roberto Azofeifa, the director of Sustainable Production at the Ministry of Agriculture, shows what kind of concrete initiatives the government promotes and supports Fairs
- the producers are not limited to selling products which fit a set of exogenous standards.
- When facing the producers themselves, the consumers can also get a better understanding of the product, which may lead them to respect it more and to reduce food waste in the household.
- The prices at the agricultural fairs, are set in relation to the alternative vendors, and their prices during the week, however here it is very possible, that people with fewer economic ressources can buy foods at low prices, because at the end of the day the producers want to sell all the foods, that they have brought to the market.

In supermarkets and stores in Europe, prices do not normally fluctuate in the same way during the course of a day. Combined with the fact that consumers value a large freedom of choice when it comes to products many stores have to throw out massive amounts of unsold food at the end of the day. The people and company behind the app Too Good To Go have decided to confront this challenge. It connects consumers with stores that have surplus food at the end of the day.

In Denmark alone, 700 thousand tons of food are thrown out every year. Only 23% of the food waste happens at the retail link however.
Therefore Too Good To Go is expanding beyond just being an app and building the organization on four pillars: producers, consumers, education and politics. 
Around 37% of all the food that is thrown out, that happens in people's homes, so when consumers are part of the Too Good To Go environment, we get a chance to communicate to them about food waste and why it's such a big problem.

The different pillars show how vital it is to combine different levers to instigate change. Transformation requires that technological progress be combined not only with better finance and behavioral change, but also better policies.

One of the political issues that we would really like to tackle and that we've have had some success with both in Denmark and in France is the problem of date labeling.
Basically people mistake the two date labels 'best before' and 'use by' and think they mean the same thing. That means that people just throw out the food whenever it reaches its 'best before'. 10% of food that is just thrown out. 

### Resilience
Regardless of the regional setting, there are ways to improve food use practices and limit the waste of food. With respect to lost production, however, the impacts of climate change represent a new and increasing mega-challenge for farmers around the world.

These impacts include increases in temperatures, changing rain patterns and more extreme weather events such as drought, heavy rain and heat waves. For smallholder and middle-scale farmers to deal with these impacts, greater resilience of their operations in the face of climate change is needed.

In Costa Rica, one way to achieve greater resilience is through agroforestry. At EARTH University in Costa Rica, they are doing agroforestry themselves in order to get experience that they can pass on to local farmers who want to make the change from traditional agriculture. Their scientists lead the work in the field.

In agroforestry, diversity of crops including different tree species and sorts is, of course, important.
As far as the benefits of agroforestry systems goes we can divide them into two views an economic and ecological one. Economically, we have the producers or people, who work in agroforestry systems, who can diversify crops, and in short medium and long term, have cash flow. Ecologically, the issue of diversity is very important today, especially in regards to the lowland here in Costa Rica. Moreover, the sustainable management of soils, in this case practices that are eco-friendly, and that somehow allow the internal cycle that gives a new level of transformations, like the transformation of organic matter, that can become more eco-friendly.
With respect to climate action, agroforestry helps bind CO2 from the atmosphere.
Introducing components of different commercial lines, like annual, perennial and shrubby components, allow the recycling process of organic matter as it is activated in the soil through microorganisms as well.

Agroforestry and agroecology both aim at producing crops in a manner that is more reminiscent of nature than is the case with the intensive farming of mono-cultures. They are not, however, just a matter of crop diversity. Central to both agroforestry and agroecology are resource recycling, general efficiency and the co-creation and sharing of knowledge.

Especially, when taking into account the role of biodiversity, as a buffer against environmental and economic risks. Agroecology systems have been shown to have a higher production than industrial monoculture in scenarios of high climate stress. For example, a study of 180 communities of smallholders in Nicaragua after Hurricane Mitch found that farms with agroecological practices on average retained 40% more topsoil than conventional farms. These practices included use of green manure, crop rotation and integration of natural elements such as stubble, ditches, terraces, barriers, mulch, legumes and trees.

Biodiversity also often plays a key role in delivering resilience as it acts as a buffer against environmental and economic risks.

To increase overall resilience of food production, climate change adaptation of farming practices is not enough. Providing farmers with insurance, not just on the food they have already produced, but also on their farm as a whole, is also important.

In this way, reduction of food waste and loss is not only about improving storage, transportation and connection between producers, vendors and consumers, but also about strengthening resilience among the farmers.

### Additional material: From Uniformity to Diversity
A paradigm shift from industrial agriculture to diversifed agroecological systems

Section 1.C: Conclusions on the outcomes of specialized industrial agriculture and diversified agroecological systems

Industrial agriculture shapes and is shaped by industrial food systems.
Industrial agriculture does not and cannot reconcile the multiple concerns of sustainable food systems. Food and farming systems can be reformed, but only by moving away from an industrial orientation and organization.

Diversified agroecological systems can provide that fundamental reorientation in a way that improves multiple outcomes.
The evidence in regard to the environmental benefits of these systems is overwhelming, from increases in wild biodiversity to the improvement of soil health and fertility and water retention. In particular, the capacity of diversified agroecological systems to restore degraded land and to keep carbon in the ground is unparalleled by any other options on the table.

Land may theoretically be ‘spared’ in industrial agricultural systems. However, the environmental benefits of such a trend are highly speculative (particulary the decline in pollinators).

> it is the reintegration of agriculture with healthy ecosystems and sustainable land management that holds the key to a range of other positive outcomes, from strong and stable outputs to secure farm livelihoods

More evidence is required on whether and to what extent diversified agroecological systems can improve farm working conditions.
It will be important to consider the alternative forms of workplace improvement offered by diversified agroecological systems – or to acknowledge potential trade-offs on this front.

There are limits in using organic agriculture as a proxy for fully diversified agroecological systems.
The picture is particularly complex in terms of food security at the macro-level, given the different ways of measuring it, and the highly divergent pathways to achieving it; diversified systems produce diverse and changing outputs, making it difficult to make meaningful projections in terms of net availability of specific crops.

The tendency to frame food security in terms of ‘feeding the world’ is itself a reflection of the systemic and self-reinforcing logic running through industrial food systems – and does not necessarily reflect what matters in terms of improving the lives of the food insecure.

The capacity of agroecological systems  has not yet had the chance to prove itself on a larger scale. They are swimming against the tide, qith little support and funding. The experimental, decentralized, knowledge-intensive nature of agroecological developments suggests that the positive impacts already observed are only just the beginning.

Additional research is also required on the process of transition itself (specially from industrialized cereal monocultures). These unknowns should not hold back the case for change, there may be no greater risk than sticking with industrial agriculture and the systematic problems it generates.

## 5. Eating Smarter
- Explain the responsibility that different actors (producers, retailers, consumers, governments, etc.) have with respect to changing people’s eating habits
- Describe the potential role of fish in future diets

### Replacing meat
Luckily, even though food choices are difficult, there are still simple, straightforward and general guidelines.
For many people in developed countries, these guidelines include the consumption of less meat. Feeding livestock with good food is an ineffective use of our sources. Reducing or eliminating meat from your diet causes less environmental damage in terms of water use, pollution, deforestation and climate change and if you make sure to get important protein and vitamins from other sources, then it's also better for your health.

For the majority of the population, changing eating habits is, however, not easy. Therefore, in order to start eating smarter, we have to crack the nut of `behavioral change`.

Artificial meat (produced from the culture of animal cells) is attracting a lot of funding for research and promises to revolutionise the price of meat. However, this process is extremely energy-consuming; therefore, it is unclear how important such products will be in transitioning to sustainable food systems.

Meat alternatives based on plant material are already on supermarket shelves in many European countries. NATURLI' has introduced plant-based products in a range of markets including Scandinavia, Great Britain and Germany.
NATURLI' has operated in the market since 1988, but it is within the last 5 years that demand has suddenly increased.
The meat alternatives that NATURLI' produces contain less protein than actual meat, and they also have a higher percentage of fat.

> At NATURLI', we believe that commodities should constantly be challenged. Presently, we work with soy beans a lot and peas as well, but the future could be in grass: a crop that grows 9 months in a year, and it has greater yield when it comes to protein compared to soy beans. The only disadvantage is that it's only the cow that can digest grass because of its four stomachs.

- 🔬 InnoGrass project: developed by GUDP (the Danish Agricultural Agency) in cooperation with DTU (Technical University of Copenhagen)

Meat alternatives based on plants are easy for the consumer to accept, but they lack nutritional quality compared to actual meat.
The opposite is true of another protein source, namely insects.
there is a great interest in cultivating the use of insects as a source of food around the world, because they are high on protein; it is a composition of fatty acids that can be found in many insects. And there are various vitamins that is otherwise hard to obtain from only a vegetarian diet, and that can be obtained in ample amounts from only eating a carnivore diet in which insects is a good example. In recent years, there have been many environmental reasoning as to why we should eat insects we should eat insects, because insects have an incredibly efficient nutrient turnover compared to i.e. cows and pigs. Insects are also more efficient when it comes to turning feed into weight. We need less space and resources in producing the same amount of energy into food when compared to animal food production

Insects are not only viewed as emergency food for survival, but they are actually a valued delicacy in many countries. Thailand currently has thousands of grasshopper and cricket farmers.

For insects to become a relevant source of food globally, their production needs to be up-scaled. This necessitates ethical, economic and health-related considerations (diseases).

### Changing habits
When changing the eating habits of a nation, state policies can play an important role.  We need also policies to support the behavioral change. The institutions need to be in place to support the sustainable consumption and sustainable eating. It was in 2012 that the Nordic nutrition recommendations integrated the sustainability goals into them. 
In the new nutrition guidelines, there are these very strong incentives to support plant-based eating even. The vegetarian days has become normal in the Finnish schools but then also having this kind of optional or vegetarian choice that you can choose, whenever you want to.
Although meat consumption in Finland has tripled since the 1950s, today’s pupils are setting a new trend.
For both children and adults, the way food is displayed can play a big role.
If we want to change eating habits soon and fast, it’s not enough to focus on the ”do’s and don’t’s”, when it comes to children. It is also possible to change the behavior of adults and especially if we can take advantage of some windows of change in our lives.

Nudging is a phenomenon that can be used to change these eating habits both at a personal and societal level. Examples: having smaller plates in the cafeteria to avoid a waste of food.

### Citizen-driven transformation
#### FoodSHIFT2030
One of the big societal questions is how the knowledge can be used at a larger scale.
At another institute at the University of Copenhagen, Christian Bugge Henriksen is also involved in behavioral change, but his focus is how to strengthen innovation that can empower normal citizens to make the changes in their eating habits. The **FoodSHIFT2030** project is a 7.5 million euro innovation action project addressing the call on innovative and citizen-driven food system approaches in cities. The focus of the project is the transition towards a low-carbon circular future for the European food system, including a focus on less meat and more plant-based diets.

The project is based on a complex full-circle approach, where innovation groups of citizens are supported in developing their ideas at different stages.
The project applies a groundbreaking mechanism for maturing, combining, up-scaling and multiplying existing food system innovations in 9 European city regions, and we are looking at both the production, the distribution and the consumption and the recycling, upcycling stage of the food value chain.
So throughout the project, we are working on 4 impact pathways: 
- citizen empowerment
- job creation
- sustainability
- food system transition

#### Plant Jammer
One of the specific citizen-driven innovations that Christian is working with, and where he earlier has helped with climate calculation on ingredients is the startup **Plant Jammer**.

In Plant Jammer, we empower people to create their own recipes ingredient by ingredient, so you can use what you have. Is really easy to both learn how to cook new stuff, but also make it easy and playful and not feel like a chore.

And particularly in the FoodSHIFT project, what we're focusing on there is that behavioral change to really enable people to cook more plant-based and cook with new ingredients that are good for you and the planet. We learned that you cannot change behavior by simply giving people information.
There are 3 particular things you need to do to change that behavior:
1. clarity: you need to know what is expected of you
2. incentives: something in it for you
3. capabilities: to be able to do it

For the incentives, we're making a little game out of this. So every time you make a plant-based dish, we're rating it in greenhouse gases relative to a burger; and, then we show you how much CO2 you're saving measured in numbers of trees you can plant. You build your own forest to show others. 

The reason why Plant Jammer is engaged in eating habits is precisely because this is an area of food systems, where individual citizens have the power to make a big difference in the world.
Is within your realm of control; so as an individual you don't need regulation, you don't need big infrastructure products; you can do it yourself. 

The engine behind Plant Jammer is based on artificial intelligence and helps making vegetarian food the easier choice.
we use artificial intelligence that learnt on 3 million recipes: what ingredients tend to go well together.

The concept is that people will do the right thing when it's the most easy thing to do, and that's what we try to do.

### Improving aquaculture
Fish still represents a good nutritional alternative to red meat today.
So what we are thinking and discussing a lot here is: we think the blue proteins would actually come in as a very important player in the protein shift. They are not as much discussed as the green ones, but they have a much lower environmental footprint than the red ones, and there are many different grades of how sustainable they are.
There are a lot of important nutrients in the fish; so, they should be more in the debate in the protein shift.

With the scale of aquacultural production today, massive amounts of protein are lost in the food chain with the processing water. So the concept, we are working on, is to make this recapturing of the proteins from the process water and into a food ingredient in a cost-effective and efficient way that makes this process worthwhile doing for the different seafood companies.

### Additional material: Focus on what you eat, not whether your food is local

<img src="../food/img/totgfs-5.5-env-impact-of-food-by-life-cycle-stage.png" width="90%">

**Eating local** is a recommendation you hear often. While it might make sense intuitively – after all, transport does lead to emissions – it is one of the most misguided pieces of advice.
Eating locally would only have a significant impact if transport was responsible for a large share of food’s final carbon footprint. For most foods, this is not the case.
GHG emissions from transportation make up a very small amount of the emissions from food and what you eat is far more important than where your food traveled from.

#### **Where do the emissions from our food come from?**  
Overall, animal-based foods tend to have a higher footprint than plant-based.
For most foods – and particularly the largest emitters – most GHG emissions result from land use change (shown in green), and from processes at the farm stage (brown). Combined, land use and farm-stage emissions account for more than 80% of the footprint for most foods.

Transport is a small contributor to emissions. For most food products, it accounts for less than 10%, and it’s much smaller for the largest GHG emitters. In beef from beef herds, it’s 0.5%.

#### **Eating local only slightly reduces your emissions**
Whether you buy it from the farmer next door or from far away, it is not the location that makes the carbon footprint of your dinner large, but the fact that it is beef.
If we were to take the case where we assume a household sources all of their food locally, the maximum reduction in their footprint would be 5%. 
Going ‘red meat and dairy-free’ (not totally meat-free) one day per week would achieve the same as having a diet with zero food miles.
There are many examples of studies which show that importing often has a lower footprint than greenhouse, refrigeration and other preservation methods.

#### **Avoid the small share of foods that are air-freighted**
The impact of transport is small for most products, but there is one exception: those which **travel by air**: it emits 50 times more CO2eq than boat per tonne kilometer.
Avocados and almonds when shipped from Mexico to the United Kingdom, its emissions are much less than locally-produced animal products. Boat shipping is 8% of avocados’ total footprint

**Which foods are air-freighted? How do we know which products to avoid?**

They tend to be foods which are highly perishable. This means they need to be eaten soon after they’ve been harvested. Some fruit and vegetables tend to fall into this category. Asparagus, green beans and berries are common air-freighted goods. 
It is often hard for consumers to identify foods that have travelled by air because they’re rarely labeled as such.

> A general rule is to avoid foods that have a very short shelf-life and have traveled a long way

The term `Jevons Paradox` flags the need to consider the different hierarchical scales at which a system under analysis changes its identity in response to an innovation.
When studying evolution and real change how can we define “what has to be sustained” in a system that continuously becomes something else?
