## 1. Introduction to the Global Food System
### Transformation of the global food system - Introduction
We must accept that we are part of a bigger system and without addressing the full implications of our actions, sustainable development of our society is impossible to achieve.

My name is Katherine Richardson. Back in 2009, I was part of a research team that presented the so-called **"planetary boundaries"**. Science tells us that humans impact the Earth at the global level. With the planetary boundaries, we are trying to examine how much we can let our activities impact the Earth System without running the risk of our impact leading to drastic changes in the conditions we experience on Earth.

We identify nine processes in the Earth System where our impacts could potentially lead to a change in the overall Earth conditions. Impact levels from [0] to [5]:
 - `Climate change` [2]
 - Novel entities [3+]
 - Stratopheric ozone depletion [0+]
 - Atmospheric aerosol loading [3+]
 - Ocean Acidification [1+]
 - `Biochemical flows`
   - Phosporous [4]
   - Nitrogen [5]
- Freshwater use [0+]
- `Land-system change` [3]
- `Biosphere integrity`
  - Functional diversity [3+]
  - Genetic diversity [5]

For four of these, Climate change, Biochemical flows, Land-system change and Biosphere integrity, our studies suggest that we have moved out of the safe operating space. In other words, our impact on these processes is already so great that it increases the risk of dramatic changes in the conditions we experience on Earth. 

Recognizing that our activities impact the Earth at the global level makes it painfully clear the need for changing the way we do many things. We need to ensure that the value society obtains from our activities comes with a minimal environmental cost.

Making sure that our demand for the Earth's resources is held to within the supply of these resources is, however, only half of the sustainability challenge. Kate Raworth, an economist at Oxford, describes the second half of the challenge. Kate identifies a doughnut-shaped space where sustainable development can occur. The outer ring on the doughnut is determined by the planetary boundaries. The inner ring by the need to secure a minimum standard of living for all human beings.
With regard to food, the two sides of the sustainability challenge are abundantly clear. On the one hand, more than 800 million people globally are chronically undernourished, while on the other, our food systems are releasing about a third of all greenhouse gases. They are also responsible for about 80% of our loss of biodiversity. Therefore, scaling up food systems as we know them today is simply not an option if we are to feed a world population that is expected to be at nine to ten billion in 2050.

> **What is needed within our global food systems then is not an upscaling, but a transformation.**

Starting with a production focus and moving towards the consumer, four vital parts of this transformation can be identified: 
1. Boosting the small
2. Tansforming the big
3. Losing less
4. Eating smarter.

New technology is not enough. Government intervention will be required, as will improved finance and behavioral change from both citizens and consumers. 
As young protesters cry across the globe: There is no planet B!

### TED talk (Video): Kate Raworth – A healthy economy should be designed to thrive, not grow

[TED talk link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rhcrbcg8HBw)

At country level, we are obsessed with growth GDP (since was invented in 1930) and mass consumption.
- We are financially addicted to gowth because today's financial system is designed to pursue the highest rate of monetary return.
- We are politically addicted to gowth because politicians want to raise tax revenue without raising taxes and a growing GDP is the way to do that
- We are socially addicted to gowth because thanks to a century of consumer propaganda, which fascinatingly was created by Edward Bernays the nephew of Sigmun Freud. He created a very lucrative retail therapy, make us believe that we transform ourselves every time we buy something more.

Global GDP is 10x bigger than it was in 1950, which has brought prosperity to billions of people. Bit the global economy has also become incredibly diviside, with the vast share of returns to wealth now ocurring to a fraction of the global 1%. And the economy has become incredibly degenerative, rapidly destabilizing this delicately balanced planet.

**doughnut framework**: We cannot let our collective resource use overshoot that outer circle, the ecological ceiling. Is a dynamic balance. We are far from balance right now: falling short and overshooting at the same time.
This is our selfie, we the people of 21st century. No economist from last century saw this picture, so why would we imagine that their theories would be up for taking on its challenges?
**We need ideas of our own, because we are the first generation to see this and probably the last with a real chance of turning this story around**

More gowth won't clean things up again.

We need to create economies that tackle this shortfall and overshoot together, by design. **We need economies that are REGENERATIVE and DISTRIBUTIVE by design.**
We have inherited degenerative industries: `TAKE(from planet) -> MAKE -> USE  -> LOSE`

We need to `REGENERATE` biological materials and `RESTORE` technical materials and avoid `TAKE`. Where waste from one process is food for the next.

This century we can design our technologies and institutions to distribute wealth,knowledge and empowerment to many. 

**When something tries to grows forever within a healthy, living, thriving system, it's a threat to the health of the whole.**

Focus on thriving and balance, within the social and the ecological boundaries of the doughnut. The world's most ingenious people turn boundaries into the source of their creativity. It's boundaries that unleash our potential. 

### The food system and its links
- How are each of the Earth System components, which are depicted and conceptualized through the planetary boundaries (see figure below), connected to our food systems? (read Campbell et al. 2017)

Why won’t new technologies alone solve the challenges in front of us? (Hints: Think, for example, of biodiversity loss and [Jevon’s Paradox](#jevons-paradox))

## 2. Boosting the Small
### Increasing know-how
The story of our current food system begins in Nigeria, Africa. By 2050 the world has to feed an additional 2 billion people, and it is here, in Africa, that most of them will live.
Smallholder farmers, that means farmers with only a couple of hectares of land, are key to feeding future populations. In 2030, it is expected there will be 750 million of these smallholder farmers worldwide.
As a start, these farmers need more knowledge concerning best practice, both because the knowledge can increase output, but also because it can contribute to improved land management.
Best practices are the small simple steps, that can make a huge impact, when looking at the overall agricultural yield of Africa. These are small skills and techniques, that farmers apply to increase the yield of their crops. It is either around the right spacing for crops, the right time to apply fertilizers or herbicides or fungicides. It is around how and where to get the right seed,

### Natural nitrogen fixation
A major challenge, facing the farmers in Africa in their daily work, is getting access to nitrogen to support plant growth.

Access to nitrogen is a double-edged sword in terms of sustainable development. Too much on your soils is a bad thing, as it causes contamination of groundwater, eutrophication of freshwater and estuarine ecosystems, atmospheric pollution and soil acidification as well as soil degradation. On the flip side, too little nitrogen results in low production yields, soil nutrient mining and soil degradation. All of these consequences lead to poor human nutrition.

Ken Giller has specialized in putting the plants that can fix nitrogen to use for small-scale farmers in Africa. These plants are called legumes: peas and beans. They provide protein, minerals, particularly for people in their diets.
They are very good in terms of the fact that they fix nitrogen from the air. 
The bacteria Rhizobium is what inyects nitrogen. So seed and bacterium needs to go togheter. By ussing legumes, smallholder farmers can boost their production with less amounts of fertilizers. Legumes are often grown with maize.
Efficient use of nitrogen fertilizers is also important in Africa.

### Better access to finance
In Costa Rica, the major obstacle for many small- and medium-sized farms is finance. Loans and investments are important for a farmer to conduct her business. But in many rural areas, interest rates for microcredit are around 35% per year.

Through public-private partnerships, public funds can be made available to support an innovative private sector, with the right experience and the knowledge to make changes in the food system.

Tips:
- tailor finance programmes to the specific needs of different farmers
- adjust the conditions of payment, period of grace, the type of guarantee depending on the project.
- follow up and support in the transformations that have to be made
- create good results: better income, less environmental impact and greater social impact on the community

### Sharing economy
Hello Tractor: rent a tractor for a period of time. For farmers with average 1,8 to 3 hectares. Usually a farmer starts to get mechanized around 5 hectares, but Hello Tractor is opening up the opportunity to receive mechanization, even when you're below that level.
Mechanization is so crucial in the crop production cycle for farmers. It has the ability to really increase and impact the yields of the farmers and their revenue in so many ways. The ability to plant 40 time faster with mechanization than manual labor. Their ability to increase up to 40% their revenue stream. And it's really, at the core, an opportunity for them to reach their potential revenue and by relying on agriculture to improve food security - because *Africa has the biggest arable land available today on Earth*.

Hello Tractor depends on booking agents. These agents are specialized farmers, who speak English fluently and possess a smartphone. When a farmer wants a tractor service he goes to our booking agents. Basically, the booking agent role is to mitigate the fact, that farmers don't necessarily use Android phones and smartphones. So they place the orders on their behalf.

In vast countries like Nigeria, where the population is very dispersed, demand for mechanized equipment is also very dispersed. In such cases, smartphone technology provides tremendous support to the sharing economy.

### A more fair trade system
Many innovations can boost the agricultural production of small-scale farmers. However, in order to actually transform food systems, changes in trade systems are also needed.
Farmers in developing countries struggle when competing with subsidized products from developed countries.
Tariffs on agricultural products are common both in North-South, and South-South trade. This makes it even more difficult for developing countries to break the patterns of trade.

Fairtrade is an organisation with a label that signals that the producers and consumers have formed a partnership.
Better knowledge and green investments are exactly what small-scale farmers need in order to sustainably boost their production.

### Additional material: Agricultural Policies at a Glance
Production-linked measures, in particular, mask market signals, harm competitiveness, and can potentially lead to environmentally-damaging production systems. Moreover, such measures can be inequitable and inefficient, as the bulk of the benefits accrue to the largest producers or leak away to unintended beneficiaries in the upstream and downstream sectors or are capitalised in the value of fixed assets. The choice of policy instruments is therefore arguably as important as the level of support.

Policy effort needs to be directed to the development of a competitive, innovative agricultural sector that can respond to future needs. Agricultural policy needs to be coherent with policies in other areas – economic, social and environmental – and to reduce impediments to structural adjustment. This kind of approach will be more effective in most countries than the fine-tuning of existing agricultural policies.

policy makers should:
- Reduce the use of market price support with a view to its eventual elimination
- Move away from the use of input subsidies:  are strongly production-distorting, and increases the risk of environmental damage from over- or misuse of farm inputs
- Increase strategic public investments to enhance sustainable productivity growth
- Target public policies to address specific goals and intended beneficiaries
- Ensure that risk management policies focus on helping farmers to cope with unavoidable and unpredictable risks
- Improve the enabling environment for a business-oriented agricultural sector.

[link](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenrg.2018.00026/full)

The term `Jevons Paradox` flags the need to consider the different hierarchical scales at which a system under analysis changes its identity in response to an innovation.
When studying evolution and real change how can we define “what has to be sustained” in a system that continuously becomes something else?
