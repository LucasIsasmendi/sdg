### Future maps
Macrotrends. They are trends that can lead to major shift in society and business. They include demographic, environmental, economic, technological, polical, and cultural shifts. While these ships can be foreseen with relatively high of certainty. Their implications are often uncertain. A set of 12 macro trends can be found in the vision 2050 issue brief developed by the world Business Council for sustainable development.

With the understanding of macrotrends businesses can generate scenarios for how their business ecosystems can evolve. Such maps of the future can help them understand how they can act they're involved in business context.

What are the most profound changes we that most companies are facing today?
1. digitalization: it will change how company operates
2. end unsustainable development.

The twenty-first century sustainable innovation is really taking the fact that weÂ´ll be eleven billion people on one planet and we need to deliver really resource-efficient and smart solutions for that. It becomes the key driver for business innovation.
So if you look at providing anything on the market, you should really shift the focus on looking at how we make this sustainable transition a business opportunity for us. 

Investors owners employees and not least customers are increasingly expecting companies to serve a purpose beyond just profit maximization. And they expect companies to actively contribute to sustainable development of our society. This combination of scientific proof and societal concern form an important driver of change and disruption. But it also results in many innovation opportunities that can form new, more sustainable business practices.

The sustainable benefits of digitalization need to be understood, even if the emissions that correspond to the ICT (Information and Communications Technologies) sector stand for approximately 1.4% of the overall global emissions

### The business opportunities of sustainable development - Why the need for change and how does it relate to business?
If we look at what is the role of business, the role of businesses to deliver goods and services to people at prices that they can afford and with minimum impact on society and the environment.
Eco-efficiency became a popular concept and it had been brought forward by industry representatives already in the earth, at the Earth Summit in 1992. The idea was to measure the relative amount of resources used and pollution created per unit of value produced.
Many agree that digitalization is crucial to fulfill the Paris Agreement and to positively impact the sustainability development goals launched in 2015.
Governments cannot solve the issues around climate change, around a number of these other environmental issues, if they don't have a committed business community.
