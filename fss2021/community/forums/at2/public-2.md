The top 10 most well represented countries at the forum were Myanmar, USA, Italy, UK, Nepal, Norway, Sweden, Australia, Kenya, and Canada.

## Session Overview
The second AT2 Public Forum was also facilitated by Paul Newnham, who is leading the Public Engagement of AT2. He is the Director of the SDG2 Advocacy Hub and Founder of the Chef’s Manifesto network.

Chef Gayatri concluded by highlighting the need for consumers to engage with farmers and understand how to make sustainable food choices

Mr. Newnham also encouraged participants to share their own solutions using the Public Survey, and thanked those who had already done so (around 350 respondents). He explained the criteria of assessment for these solutions: impact, actionability and sustainability. Once assessed, these solutions would be posted in the Food Systems Community platform, where people can engage with the work streams and with one another. These solutions would then also be made available to the public.

## WS1
The members of Work Stream 1 **`(WS1) on Food Environment`** then presented their solution. Jian Yi, President of the Good Food Fund in China and the lead for WS1, introduced the solution, developed by Patrick Webb: linking consumers directly to farmers, through institutional pathways such as public procurement.

The first to comment on the solution was Lucy Westerman:
1. ow can procurement promote local, nutritious foods while ensuring their financial viability;
2. how can local procurement policies leverage dietary guidelines and food profiling/labelling measures, while tailoring these to local culture and knowledge; and
3. what monitoring and accountability mechanisms can be implemented to overcome corrupt systems and how can communities play a role?

Anne Dioh, the coordinator for Senegal at the SUN business network and a member of the WS2, was the next to give her comments.
1. the financial capacity of the public sector may not be enough for sustainable procurement in low income countries; 
2. the communication strategy should go beyond encouraging consumers to make better choices to promote healthy food as an aspirational more than a rational choice; and 
3. providing training to those responsible for public procurement, who act as the crucial link between producers and consumers.

leveraging other measures through public procurement, which could stimulate production of nutritious food, increase nutritional awareness and practices such as gardening. He also emphasised the importance of civil society in implementing monitoring mechanisms that ensure transparency and accountability.

Regarding the communication strategy, Mr. Yi spoke about the synergies between `WS1` (food environment) and `WS2` (food demand), and how changing consumer behaviour would require interventions in both areas.

## WS2
Daniel Vennard (Better Buying Lab) and Luke Spajic (UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network – Youth), were the next to present their solution for **`WS2 on Food Demand`**: incorporating sustainability into national dietary guidelines.
Ms. Graf (UNFCCC) mentioned
1. it does not consider that dietary guidelines do not usually influence individual or institutional food choices.
2. should also be affordable compared to more processed, less nutritious alternatives, through either subsidies or other incentives.
3. these guidelines need to be made more appealing to local consumers, especially as cooking is often a family and cultural tradition.

Dr. Branca (UN anchor agency for AT2) pointed out that dietary guidelines are not just for consumers, they also inform several national nutrition policies and programmes. While many countries (90-120) have dietary guidelines, very few of them actually utilise them in designing programmes for, say, public procurement. Thus, if dietary guidelines could actually be translated into policies, it would have major impacts on health, food systems and the economy.

## WS3
Liz Goodwin (WRI - Food Loss and Waste), the deputy lead for **`WS3 on Food Waste`**, and Roman Davas-Fahey (Climate-Proof Food), a youth member of WS3, then presented their solution.
Ms. Goodwin began by highlighting that for many governments across the world, food waste and loss are not high priorities. However, these are complex issues that require collaboration between government, private sector and civil society.
The solution proposed, 50 by 50 by 30, involved getting 50 countries to commit to halving their food waste by 2030.

Lasse Bruun (50by40), was the first to comment on the solution:
1. fairness of approach, where post-harvest loss in low-income countries should be treated as a more pressing issue concerning food security than consumer waste in high-income countries;
2. stakeholder engagement at the subnational/municipality level, which is essential for translating national policies into procurement plans. Farmers need to be a part of this process from the beginning, which would involve working with unions such as the ILO, IRF and La Via Campesina;
3. the solution should anticipate increased post-harvest loss due to extreme weather events caused by climate change. Efforts should be made to shift to a plant-based food system, as industrialised animal agriculture is not only a form of food waste but also threatens food system stability (as the Covid pandemic has shown).

Emeline Fellus (FReSH project - WBCSD), member of WS1, then gave her views on the solution: acknowledged the importance of reducing food waste as a game-changing solution that affects all the 12 SDGs. It proposes a national level approach. Measurement would also be a very significant part of this approach, so developing an easy to implement methodology for the same would help assess the impact of the solution. The narrative around the solution could be changed from one of reducing waste to emphasising the potential benefits for food system actors.

Ms. Goodwin responded to the comments by acknowledging the importance of the target, measure and act approach, which would help understand the specific problems and focus on a solution accordingly. Concerning stakeholder engagement, she mentioned that the solution needs to benefit all stakeholders in the supply chain. In terms of measurement, efforts should be made to improve the ease of use of indices such as the Food Waste Index to be released by UN Environment and the Food Loss Index. Mr. Davas-Fahey suggested that resources and infrastructure could be exported to help low-income countries deal with post-harvest losses, which could have been exacerbated by the pandemic. He also agreed that industrialised agriculture, which is an inefficient form of production, should be considered a form of waste.

## End
The session was then concluded by Paul Newnham and Dr. Gunhild Stordalen, the Founder and Executive Chair of EAT and the Chair for Action Track 2. Mr. Newnham encouraged the participants to continue their engagement with the summit process by sharing their ideas through the Public Surveys. the Food Systems Summit is an occasion for dugnad (a Norwegian word that represents people coming together and contributing to a greater good). Thus, the Summit would collaborate with all food system actors to commit to meaningful actions. Ultimately, the success of the summit would be measured by how the solutions on paper are translated into game-changing actions on the ground.

## Q&A
1. `JY`: the second largest number of solutions we have received have been related to reducing the consumption of animal foods. We need to build mechanisms to help align these goals with government priorities. We also need to increase choices for plant-based foods, which would help people change their food choices.
4. `FB`: we need to bring the number of countries with FBDGs (food-based dietary guidelines) from 120 to 194.
6. `FB`: I think the pain point of dietary guidelines is how we treat meat. I think we definitely need to discuss this with a scientific viewpoint, but also with an eye to potential alternatives and complements in terms of animal-sourced food.
7. `LG`: I think there is another barrier, which is funding. Because of the lack of awareness, nobody wants to fund anything on food. `RD`: As far as barriers for people in government, I think the creation of entities devoted to reducing food waste and loss might be a pathway to overcome them.
8. `LB`: I think, in the coming years, we need to see a much stronger focus on looking at food waste from the life cycle perspective. One of the biggest issues we need to address is industrialized animal agriculture. `EF`: One of the other game-changing initiatives that we're thinking of across the different action tracks is something that we call the true value of food. It's not about increasing the price, it's about how can we try and stimulate funding towards supporting food that is produced in a sustainable way, that is not wasted and that contributes to more healthy diets. That's a whole subject in itself, but I think that's a critical component of changing the rules of the game.
11. `LB`: The US, for instance, produces four times the amount of food than what people actually eat. And that's because there's a system based on having large surplus of food and food storage from WWII. We don't need all that surplus storage anymore. That leads to food waste. `LG`: We need to have more transparency, visibility and sharing of risks up and down the supply chain, rather than a contractual arrangement that results in the farmer bearing all the risk. `EF`: use the bananas that don't look so good and put them back into the production of other products, but that requires collaboration.
