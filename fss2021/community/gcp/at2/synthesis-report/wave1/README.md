## Introduction

### Action Track 2 goals
This report presents the first wave of proposed frameworks of action to achieve the goals of Action Track 2: Shift to sustainable and healthy consumption patterns.

**Key outcomes** to which the proposed solutions should contribute include:
- A dramatic increase in the diversity, availability, accessibility and affordability, of safe foods that contribute to healthy diets from sustainable food systems, especially whole grains, legumes and nuts, and fresh vegetables and fruits. Particularly for vulnerable and poor population groups, sufficient quantities of healthy protein and micronutrient sources are needed (sustainably-produced dairy, eggs, blue foods, meat).
- A major shift in demand for and/or consumption of safe foods that contribute to healthy diets from sustainable food systems. including more than doubling the consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes and nuts;
- At the global level, and particularly with respect to more affluent populations, a reduction of excessive consumption of animal-sourced foods, especially red meat, and an increase in consumption of plant-rich diets and a switch to animal products from sustainable practices;
- A reduction in consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and foods high in unhealthy fats, free sugars, and salt/sodium;
- Food safety ensured from production to consumption, food safety systems in LMICs are strengthened to improve traceability and the burden of food borne disease associated with biological or chemical hazards is reduced significantly;
- Halving per capita food waste at household, food service and retail levels by 2030 (`SDG target 12.3`) and transitioning to a circular food economy where recycling and repurposing food waste becomes the norm;
- Strengthened connections between consumers and producers of food, including by fostering development of more robust value and gender-responsive chains (local where feasible), creating solid alliances between farmers and civil society and harnessing the potential of food markets (including wet markets) to offer affordable healthy, safe, and territorial food options;
- equitable international trade facilities access to foods that contribute to healthy diets from sustainable food systems
- Widespread awareness of both the urgency and multiple co-benefits of food system transformation and increased political commitment at all levels to drive the transition towards healthy and sustainable consumption.

### Action Track 2 structure 
The work of Action Track 2 is divided into three workstreams:
1. [WS1](#work-stream-1--food-environments) - **Food environments**: To create healthy, safe and sustainable food environments to enable people to adopt and maintain healthy dietary practices.
2. [WS2](#work-stream-2--food-demand) - **Food demand**: To improve the product experience of healthier and more sustainable food and improve consumers motivation and capability. 
3. [WS3](#work-stream-3--food-waste) - **Food waste**: To reduce food waste occurring at household, food service and retail level.

### Process preceding the proposed solutions
All the solutions received were analyzed and screened based on three key criteria:
- **Impact**: provides long-term economic, environmental and societal value at scale, addresses the main and most urgent challenges facing food systems production and has synergies (and no/low trade-offs) with other actions and sustainable food systems already in place.
- **Actionability**: are designed to target a specific area of improvement, specifies the measurable outcomes, accounts for the given situation and resources to make sure the solutions are feasible to implement, and declares accountability for achieving the outcomes.
- **Sustainability**: has the ability to keep delivering to 2030 and beyond.

## Work Stream 1 – Food Environments

### Solution 1 - Food Systems Framework
Facilitating Cross Sector Assessments and National Action Plans up to 2030
- **Problem**: There is currently no comprehensive or standard framework for assessing food systems at the national level. There is no way to simultaneously tie food systems with climate goals, biodiversity goals and public health goals – and to assess the robustness of food systems in relation to environmental or other shocks. 
- **Solution**: 
  - develop a Food Systems Blueprint
  - HICs will fund LMICs assessments
  - LMICs to develop regionally specific roadmaps with clear timeline
  - HICs to set highly ambitious National Action Plans that surpass the requirements
  - Food Systems Team/Department in HICs and LMICs at the national level.
  - development of sector specific guidance stemming from the National Action Plans with a multi stakeholder approach
  - HICs will fund LMICs implementation

### Solution 2 - City region food strategies
Local Food Markets
- **Problem**: 54% of the world’s populations now living in cities, they have become epicenters of food consumption. Yet all too many cities struggle to create food environments where the ingredients of healthy and sustainable diets are available, accessible, and affordable.
- **Solution**: City Region Food Strategies – or city region Food Markets - are a critical tool for creating local demand and markets for fresh, healthy food. Proactive city region food strategies create enabling environments for healthy and sustainable dietary practices by ensuring the availability, affordability, access and information on healthy foods, particularly those that pertain to local and indigenous food systems (the “flavor” of the region).
  - Supporting farmer transitions to nature positive food practices
  - Offering low/subsidised rents and favourable lands or locations in and around the city
  - Favoring direct public procurement for city schools and offices from farmers
  - Cities create urban food environments where healthy and sustainable foods become the default

### Solution 3 - Fiscal policy
Fiscal Policy Measures to improve food environments
- **Problem**: The SOFI 2020i report highlights that 3 billion people cannot afford a healthy diet.
- **Solution**: 
  - Taxes on unhealthy foods
  - Tax related to carbon footprint via VAT
  - Subsidies for healthy foods
  - Income transfer model
- **Source**: Varios

### Solution 4 - Education
Formal and informal education strategies
- **Problem**: Curricula around the world do not adequately incorporate education on food systems, including their substantial impact on global environmental issues, or their interconnectedness across health, climate, and biodiversity. At the same time, media coverage regarding the impacts of food systems has been low. 
- **Solution**: The education solution contains formal and informal curriculum packages, applicable across different societal groups.
- **Source**: Varios

### Solution 5 - Action hubs
National Food System Action Hubs
- **Problem**: Building on the Summit and looking forward, it is critical to create spaces for all relevant stakeholders, including the general public, to engage in the transformation of food systems and to take part in generating ideas, sharing views and collaborating in developing solutions that can be put into action.
- **Solution**: National Food System Action Hubs can connect all stakeholders of the food system and facilitate innovations and collaborations as well as provide a platform for monitoring progress. They can create an “eco-system” for food systems stakeholders (policy makers, academia, private sector, civil society) to drive positive change together.
- **Source**: This solution is based on conversations within Workstream 1.

### Initiative – Civil society and youth
Mobilizing civil society and lifting up youth-led initiatives (Activate the Activists)
- **Problem**: The ‘sleeping giant’ in the power game is civil society (including consumers/citizens) which potentially has a lot of collective power but is usually poorly coordinated and funded and therefore weak. The problem is policy inertia – the big players (governments and food industry) will not enact the game-changing policies in those reports unless there is social demand for them. Collective thinking and action across different sectors of the food system is necessary to deliver a more sustainable future.
- **Initiative**: The [Bloomberg Approach] is purposeful funding of civil society organizations to bring about policy change and measure its impact. Among the strategies civil society has used are: 
  1. effective coordination across sectors
  2. communications to create demand for policies
  3. social lobbying to inform and influence legislation, regulation, and policies
  4. scientific evidence of the need for shifts and impacts of the policy implementation.
  - Real Food Systems is an organization of youth ambassadors who stand for plant- based whole foods as the foundation of human and planetary health.
  - Groups: Bloomberg Philanthropies, Food@COP, Real Food Systems, Youth Climate Save, Youth Pledge (led by youth members of the UNFSS action tracks and affiliated organizations) the Food Foundation (UK)

## Work Stream 2 – Food Demand
### Solution 7 – Power and accountability
Transforming power dynamics that shape food demand; creating accountability mechanisms that empower governments and civil society to drive change and reward good corporate behavior

- **Problem**: Simply inserting new solutions into a system that is structured towards the promotion of unhealthy unstainable diets will result in changes that are unlikely to scale or endure.
- **Solution**: implement a range of mechanics that foster accountability for the health and environmental consequences of a company’s actions and empower government and civil society to take remedial action. An ‘accountability package’ that governments would then be supported to implement, monitor and maintain. Such mechanism will include:
  - A tight set of aligned, evidence-based health and sustainability targets with associated metrics
  - Support to help governments mandate public reporting by companies against the key metrics
  - Engagement with Investors to align the metrics to their loan and credit facilities.
  - Policies that limit industries involvement in policy making areas which have a conflict of interest 
- **Source**: based on conversations within Workstream 2. It builds upon a range of solutions submitted through the solution sourcing process run by Workstream 2.

### Solution 8 - Labeling
Front of pack nutrition and eco labelling for promoting healthy and sustainable diets in points-of-sale and out-of-home

- **Problem**: Unhealthy diets are among the top leading causes of disease, death, undernutrition, obesity and climate change globally. Only a minority of the public is aware that their diets have an impact on the environment. Front-of-pack labelling (FOPL) is an important policy tool for countries to help consumers make healthier food choices.
- **Solution**: Research has consistently shown an association between use of nutrition labels and healthier diets. FOPL may be a comprehensive action to address unhealthy diets and help move consumers toward more plant-based, sustainable diets and reduced obesogenic environments. Codex Alimentarius is preparing guidelines on front-of-pack nutrition labelling

### Solution 9 - Breastfeeding
Ensure a breastfeeding-friendly environment, emphasizing workplaces, health systems and community settings, with proven effective interventions and adequate investment
- **Problem**: Only 42.2% of the infants under 6 months are exclusively breastfed; yet optimal breastfeeding can save 820,000 children’s lives a year.
- **Solution**: Research has consistently shown an association between breastfeeding with healthy and sustainable short and long-term benefits, including reduced mortality
- **Source**: Several organizations

### Solution 10 - Demand package
Package of Demand Interventions
- **Problem**: Unhealthy and unsustainable consumption patterns are partially attributed to marketing practices that influence consumers excessive consumption of unhealthy and unsustainable food. There is often a lack of government measures and controls to curb this influence.
- **Solution**: AT2 is proposing a program that works with national and municipal policy leaders to develop and implement a ‘package of demand interventions’ that, together, re-shape consumption patterns towards more healthy and sustainable diets.
  - Dividing food into 3 groups based on scores to signal desirable frequency of consumption – Eat Regularly, Eat Occasionally, Eat Rarely. On pack visuals can be used to support this through mandatory labelling.

## Work Stream 3 – Food Waste
### Solution 11 – Food is never waste
Food is never waste - Interventions to deliver more circular food systems
- **Problem**: Globally 1/3 of food is lost and wasted between farm and fork each year. It results in $940 billion/y of economic losses across the supply chain. This amount consumes 1⁄4 of the world’s freshwater use by agriculture, occupies farmland area greater than the size of China, and emits ~8% of global greenhouse gases. A significant portion of these are GHG emissions from landfills caused by food waste decomposition. Food waste constitutes between 35-60% of landfilled material. Although SDG Target 12.3 calls for cutting food waste by 50% and reducing food loss by 2030, the world is not yet on track.
- **Solution**: This idea brings together proven policy interventions with new technologies to ensure no food is wasted. These interventions ensure food waste is measured and prevented, redistributed to those in need, or is used as a feedstock for processing into valuable products in line with principles of circularity.

### Solution 12 – 150x50x30
150x50x30: 150 countries launch national public-private partnerships and campaigns to reduce their food loss and waste by 50% by 2030

- **Problem**: Same as solution 11
- **Solution**: national public-private partnership dedicated to FLW reduction. Countries will come from all six inhabited continents and will collaborate with companies, civil society, and the World Bank.
- **Source**: Craig Hanson, World Resources Institute, through public survey.

### Solution 13 – Activate the activists
Activate the Activists: Ending Food Waste Through a Global Activist Network
- **Problem**: Same as solution 11
- **Solution**: The project will support activists with a toolbox of tried and tested approaches to consumer behaviour change. It engages and empowers people at a local level to bring about solutions which they own. The network would collaborate and leverage social media. The end goal is to shift the social norm so it is no longer culturally acceptable to waste food, as has been the case for most of human history.  Food should be a valued resource, not a commodity which can be thrown away at will and replaced.

### Solution 14 - Reduce global food loss
Investing $1 trillion to reduce global food loss of high-impact commodities by 2025
- **Problem**: A food system imperative is to reduce commodity losses so we can improve agricultural yields that use finite natural resources. High-emission supply chains such as beef, dairy, and rice contribute at least 70% of agricultural emissions globally. FAO estimates 475 million tons of lost food could be saved through refrigeration alone. We must reduce on-farm and post-harvest food loss, establish real-time loss measurement and diagnostics capabilities
- **Solution**: Reducing on-farm and post-harvest loss requires a multi-faceted approach including
  - Establishing multi-billion-dollar global investment mechanisms to improve cold chains, farm technology, knowledge, and loss reduction solutions
  - Scaling pilot projects that have already proven to increase food security while mitigating climate change
  - Establishing real-time commodity loss measurement and establishing a country-level diagnostic information network
  - Providing ongoing business case development for food loss interventions

## Cross Cutting Solutions
### Solution 15 - A Just Transition
Enable a Just Transition of livestock production to mitigate climate change, improve health and create jobs.
- **Problem**: 77% of global agricultural land is used to grow and feed livestock, while providing just 17% of global calories and 33% of global protein supply.
  - Livestock production currently accounts for at least 14.5% of all GHG emissions and is projected to account for up to 81% by 2050 if production continues unabated.
  - Meat production accounts for 73% of global antibiotic use (hig threat of AMR).
  - About 75% of all emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic in nature
  - Over-consumption of animal products is also detrimental to human health 
  -  there is a global consumer-driven shift favouring plant-based products.
- **Solution**: Just transformation of livestock production is not only instrumental to solving climate crisis, but also brings numerous environmental and socio-economic benefits:
  - Reversing environmental degradation and improving the local environment
  - Creating better public health; saving millions in health costs; increasing overall resilience to pandemics
  - Improving the socioeconomics of the farming system including a revitalisation of rural economies: transition will net 15 million jobs
  - It is crucial to prevent unsustainable animal agriculture intensification in the Global South where meat consumption is on the rise.

### Solution 16 - Food-based dietary guidelines
Leveraging Food-Based Dietary Guidelines through Public Procurement
- **Problem**: 90 countries around the world had FBDGs. Few consider sustainability issues. FBDGs should consider sustainability concerns in addition to dietary nutrition. FBDGs would also provide a solid foundation for educating citizens about sustainable and healthy diets in their given context.
- **Solution**: All countries should have FBDGs, based on sound science, tailored to their specific context, and in line with the UN SDGs and international commitments. The dietary nutrition aspect of existing FBDGs should be evaluated, including with consideration to intertwined sustainability perspectives such as equity, access, and cultural norms.
