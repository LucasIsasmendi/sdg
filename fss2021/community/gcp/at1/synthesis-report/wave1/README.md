## Introduction
### Goals
AT1 aims to end hunger and all forms of malnutrition and reduce the incidence of diet-related non-communicable disease (NCD).
AT1 organised our search for sustainable, actionable solutions with potential for impact at scale along three main themes:
1. **Zero Hunger**: 700 million people are undernourished, and one quarter of the worldâ€™s population is food insecure. Countries that are experiencing conflict and fragility are where hunger is rising the fastest.
2. **Access to Nutritious Food**: 3 billion people cannot afford to purchase a healthy, balanced diet. Barriers to access: price, purchasing power and perceived affordability
3. **Food Safety**: shifting from hazard thinking to risk thinking

### Structure
Within the leadership team, work is divided into three working groups aligning to the themes noted above, each led by AT1 leadership team members:
- (1) Reducing hunger, led by Samuel Benin and Natalia Strigin
- (2) Increasing access to affordable, nutritious foods, led by Corrina Hawkes
- (3) Increasing food safety, led by Delia Grace and Pawan Agrawal

### Process for Identifying and Developing the Ideas in this Paper
- We created an online Google Form through which stakeholders and members of the public could submit their ideas, which then fed into an idea database; 
- Members of the AT1 support team reviewed a number of recent high-profile international reports (e.g., SOFI 2020, Ceres2030, PARI 2020, OECD 2021) to extract relevant ideas with broad and/or high-level support, which were added to the abovementioned database.
- our search for impactful solutions will continue in the coming months, and the solutions presented here will continue to be refined, developed further, and contextualised through active engagement with diverse stakeholders, including member states.

## Potential Solutions for Reducing Hunger
1. **Establish a Zero Hunger Fund**
   - solution: generate USD 4-5 billion a year.
   - source: Ceres2030 Report, PARI (2020) report
   - problem: funding gap
   - address problem: accelerate efforts
2. **Democratise precision agriculture (PA) technologie**s
   - solution: public/private partnerships
   - source: Working Group, Dutch government, IFPRI. others
   - problem: precision agriculture tools do not reach poor smallholders
   - address problem: with PA they will grow more food with less effort
3. **Expand coverage of social protection systems**
   - solution: scaling-up social protection programmes, especially cash transfers
   - source: universal social protection systems of 1.3 billion people
   - problem: Food insecurity itself involves dimensions of both availability of food and access to food.
   - address problem: builds on existing platforms of social assistance programs and cash transfer. Amplify its coverage potential by more investments in delivery systems, increase financing, more adaptive systems, government social protection systems as a default platform
   - systemic criteria: 
     - impact:strongly relevant in fragile states, highly relevant in shock-affected areas, for urban and rural contexts
4. **Establish a catalytic SME financing facility to transform food systems**
   - solution: multi-donor funded Facility to invest in agri-food SMEs
