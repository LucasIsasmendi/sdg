- **source**: `AT2-second-wave-of-solutions-synthesis-report.pdf`
- **date**: `21 May 2021`

This document reflects the ‘second wave’ of solution propositions emerging from the work of Action Track 2 as of 21 May 2021.

**Summary of Wave 2 ideas**:  
1. **Marketing and advertising**
   - [1.1](#solution-11---demand-generation-for-healthy-and-sustainable-food) Need to make nutritious foods from sustainable food systems the preferred choice for consumers => shape society-wide consumer preferences
   - 1.2: Meat consumption is frequently associated with masculinity, which produces overconsumption and production: unhealthy and unsustainable => campaign to dissociate meat consumption and masculinity
   - 1.3: transparent and useful information on nutrition and sustainability is rarely available to consumers, hard to change habits to healthier and sustainable products => regulate marketing, add new tools and incentives, unify product labelling, consumer rights
   - [1.4](#solution-14---investing-in-better-public-sector-marketing): motivate and empower consumers so they seek nutrition information in the food environment => promotion of healthy diets from sustainable production systems by restricting marketing that promotes unhealthy diets. Taxes on advertising that promotes unhealthy diets.
2. **Supply Chains**
   - [2.1](#solution-21---campagna-amica): gap between producers and consumers => improve consumer information, awareness, and education; promote local agriculture, reduce transportation, waste, packaging, more. Example: Campagna Amica
   - [2.2](#solution-22---supporting-short-food-supply-chains): Food supply chains have become increasingly complex, with more processing and transportation stages => complementary short food supply chains: farmer to consumer sales
3. **Blue Food**
   - 3.1: overexploitation and illegal practices => food security kitemark “no harm”
4. **Finance and investments**
   - 4.1: challenges to financing transition steps to food system transformation => The World Bank’s new Food Systems 2030 Trust Fund for food systems transition will capture these impacts
5. **Appropriate food processing**
   - [5.1](#solution-51---microbiome-based-nutritional-intervention): understanding of microbiome to solve malnutrition => functional foods (food as medicine) to help combat malnutrition. Increased role of microbiome insight in food safety and regulation
   - [5.2](#solution-52---government-led-reformulation-of-packaged-food-products): Limited awareness of the different levels of food processing (from minimal to ultra) and their impacts on nutritional value and dietary health => dietary guidelines should emphasize preference for fresh or minimally processed foods and the avoidance of ultra-processed foods. The food manufacturing industry should develop or improve alternatives to ultra-processing of food.
   - [5.3](#solution-53---emphasis-on-appropriate-food-processing-in-all-food-and-nutrition-policies): Limited awareness of the different levels of food processing (from minimal to ultra) and their impacts on nutritional value and dietary health => preference for fresh or minimally processed foods and the avoidance of ultra-processed foods on dietary guidelines
6. **Government policy/legislation**
   - [6.1]: consumer engagement as a force for innovation is underutilized => strength the role of consumers and consumer rights in policy-making and standard-setting
7. **Increasing supply of non-meat protein and crops diversification**
   - [7.1]: FAO projects a 52% increase in the global demand for meat by 2050, but there are not enough resources on our planet to meet this demand => Accelerating the diversification of proteins that are appealing, accessible, and affordable will be key to feeding 10 billion people within planetary boundaries by 2050
   - [7.2]: shift to meat responsibly produced, accessible and consumed as part of a sustainable food system => Responsible Meat (ReMi) criteras: environmental performance, working conditions, and animal welfare
   - [7.3]: Food systems heavily rely on 5 key commodities (staple crops). Lack of nutrients, negative health outcomes, decreased climate and economic resilience => Diversifying staples
8. **One Health**
   - [8.1]: reduce the use of antimicrobials and combat the rising tide of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) => Good hygiene and biosecurity measures as well as strong environmental controls need to be implemented at scale
   - [8.2]: Implement at global scale AMR National Action Plans (NAPs) => Global AMR Multi-Partner Trust Fund (AMR MPTF) is providing a valuable vehicle to support coordinated action on AMR
9. **The role of data sharing and transparency**
   - [9.1]: Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is not supporting sustainable food systems from healthy diets => develop an internationally recognised best practice guide for assessing and comparing the environmental and nutritional impacts of different food items
   - [9.2]: important gaps in the evidence base, and the advice provided by different research groups can sometimes be conflicting => International Platform for Food System Science – IPFSS
10. **Informal food vendors**
    - [10.1]: Food in informal markets is often unsafe with high levels of contaminants and pathogens => improve the healthfulness and safety of foods sold while maintaining affordability. Key areas of action include training, certification, and business and marketing interventions paired with provision of water and sanitation facilities.

## Gap 1: Marketing and advertising – incl. social marketing
### Solution 1.1 - Demand generation for healthy and sustainable food
- **Problem**: nutritious foods from sustainable food systems, must shift from niche to mainstream consumption. We need a radical change in how consumers think and act about food. There is no one actor who alone can shape or be responsible for shifting consumer demand.
- **Solution**: change consumers’ mindsets. The Demand Generation Alliance will mobilize cross-sector alliances in countries to deploy new strategies to shift preferences in the right direction.

### Solution 1.4 - Investing in better public sector marketing
> Social marketing to create and sustain desire for specific foods and healthy diets from sustainable production systems

- **Problem**: Public sector marketing in the nutrition sector has not been effective. It focuses on diet and foods, motivation, unhealthy is present everywhere.
- **Solution**: create desire for healthy diets from sustainable production systems. Treats diets and foods as a connected structure, use of emotions, restrict marketing from unhealthy diets. Use best practice in advertising and communication
- **Source**: GAIN has been developing this idea for some time

## Gap 2: Short Supply Chains
### Solution 2.1 - Campagna Amica
> A Farmers’ Market Network that promotes and valorises producers-led initiatives for more sustainable and informed consumption pathways, involving more than 10.000 farmers

- **Problem**: gap between producers and consumers
- **Solution**: build food environments that make sustainable (local production, seasonality, regenerative agriculture, over-packaging) and healthy dietary choices the preferred ones and show the link between good nutrition and the environment (direct educational exchange). set of rules and controls in terms of behaviour, hygiene standards, transparency and labels

### Solution 2.2 - Supporting short food supply chains
> Proposing a program to motivate national and local authorities to support direct trade relationships between producer and consumer

- **Problem**: Mass production, hyper-processing and transportation all have considerable environmental costs. They also threaten the livelihood of small non-industrial farms and artisanal food producers. Because of the consumer benefits, this system will not be easy to change.
- **Solution**: Short Food Supply Chain (SFSC) refers to any form of direct sale from farmers to consumer. They offer transparency to the consumer, and provide opportunities for small scale farmers and artisans to work in more sustainable ways. Is aimed to minimize the number of intermediaries and allows partnerships between producers and consumers. Example: https://www.openfoodnetwork.org/. They need support to become more convenient and appeal to larger audiences. The presence of farmers’ markets promotes healthier food habits and lifestyles.

## Gap 3: Blue Food

## Gap 4: Finance and investments

## Gap 5: Appropriate food processing
### Solution 5.1 - Microbiome-Based Nutritional Intervention
Harnessing the Role of the Microbiome in Food as Medicine
- **Problem**: The critical driver of both under- and overnutrition is the lack of healthy amounts of nutrients. A greater understanding of the role of nutrients on metabolic processes by way of gut microbiota will inform solutions across the spectrum of malnutrition and pave the way for functional food
- **Solution**: scale up the integration of microbiome knowledge, understanding and data to enable the design of foods as medicine for individuals suffering from malnutrition. Steps: (1) centralize research and knowledge. (2) define a set of guidelines and strategies for evaluating foods. (3) mobilize cross-sector alliances

### Solution 5.2 - Government-led reformulation of packaged food products
to reduce sodium and sugar and eliminate industrial produced trans fatty acid
- **Problem**: The retail food sector has seen dramatic growth over the last 2-3 decades. Policy interventions are needed to curb the rising health burden and premature mortality caused by increasing processed food consumption.
- **Solution**: Government-led reformulation of packaged food allows governments to set targets for key categories of packaged food to limit the amount of nutrients, such as sodium, sugars, and trans-fat, permitted in packaged food products. Only nine countries have set mandatory targets for multiple categories, demonstrating a need for further action in this area.

### Solution 5.3 - Emphasis on appropriate food processing in all food and nutrition policies
- **Problem**: a sequence of industrial processes which convert a few whole foods into chemically modified food substances and formulate them with a myriad of additives to make products with highly attractive or even quasi-addictive sensory properties identified as ultra-processed foods
- **Solution**: emphasize both the preference for fresh or minimally processed foods and the avoidance of ultra-processed foods. Implement fiscal and other statutory instruments to promote a rich variety of fresh or minimally processed foods, and to discourage consumption of ultra-processed foods. Improve processing methods that prolong the duration of whole foods and make their culinary preparation easier.

## Gap 6: Government policy/legislation 

## Gap 7: Increasing supply of non-meat protein and crops diversification
### Solution 7.1 - Diversify the Global Protein Supply via Alternative Proteins 
- **Problem**: not enough resources on our planet to meet 2050 meat demand. Alternative proteins (plant-based and algae-based, fermentation derived, cultivated meat) can help address key social and health challenges of the coming decades such as reducing the risk of bacterial contamination, improving animal welfare, reducing antimicrobial resistance as well as risks of another pandemic.
- **Solution**: build evidence on science-based targets, pathways, key challenges and opportunities. Develop strategies to scale up alternative protein production and consumption. Mobilize cross-sector alliances to deploy these strategies at global and local levels
