**In the age of pandemics, connecting food systems and health: a Global One Health approach**
### 1. callenges
- Interconnection between ecosystems, human and animal health - zoonotic infectious diseases
- Poor human health facilitates infectious disease spread: Similar to other infectious diseases, COVID-19 disproportionately affects those with poor nutritional status and underlying health issues.
### 2. impacts of zoonotic infectious diseases on food secutiy
- direct: disrupt the workforce, supply chain and movement of goods
- indirect impacts: disrupt the livelihoods of ~ 1 billion people with jobs in the food value chain
- SARS-CoV-2 and other infectious pathogens in the food chain
  - can be transmitted via many different routes, including water and food products natural/frozen.
  - the range and outbreak frequencies of these disruptors of the food supply chain and health are expected to change due to the effects of climate change.
###  3. Adapting the agri-food to limit pathogen risk
- reducing the need for natural habitat disruption through sustainable intensification of land use 
- smart management and vigilance at the interfaces by surveillance and readiness to intervene
- improving overall human, animal and environmental health, a Global One Health approach

### 4. Towards food system resilience
- Resilient systems allowing for rapid recovery are needed to minimize direct and indirect health effects of shocks to the food system.
- the dots between the food system, and environmental, animal, plant and human health are becoming more connected in global, regional and national initiatives
- the European commission is moving towards a code of conduct for participants in the food supply chain. 
- September 2020, the creation of a One Health High-Level expert council by UN Environment, FAO, OIE and WHO to address risks at the human-animal-environment interface
