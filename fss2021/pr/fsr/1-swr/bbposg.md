## In the age of pandemics, connecting food systems and health: a Global One Health approach
### 1. callenges
- Interconnection between ecosystems, human and animal health - zoonotic infectious diseases
- Poor human health facilitates infectious disease spread: Similar to other infectious diseases, COVID-19 disproportionately affects those with poor nutritional status and underlying health issues.
### 2. impacts of zoonotic infectious diseases on food secutiy
- direct: disrupt the workforce, supply chain and movement of goods
- indirect impacts: disrupt the livelihoods of ~ 1 billion people with jobs in the food value chain
- SARS-CoV-2 and other infectious pathogens in the food chain
  - can be transmitted via many different routes, including water and food products natural/frozen.
  - the range and outbreak frequencies of these disruptors of the food supply chain and health are expected to change due to the effects of climate change.
###  3. Adapting the agri-food to limit pathogen risk
- reducing the need for natural habitat disruption through sustainable intensification of land use 
- smart management and vigilance at the interfaces by surveillance and readiness to intervene
- improving overall human, animal and environmental health, a Global One Health approach

### 4. Towards food system resilience
- Resilient systems allowing for rapid recovery are needed to minimize direct and indirect health effects of shocks to the food system.
- the dots between the food system, and environmental, animal, plant and human health are becoming more connected in global, regional and national initiatives
- the European commission is moving towards a code of conduct for participants in the food supply chain. 
- September 2020, the creation of a One Health High-Level expert council by UN Environment, FAO, OIE and WHO to address risks at the human-animal-environment interface

## The Bioeconomy and Food Systems Transformation

### 1. Bioeconomy concepts and contributions
The bioeconomy concept has been favored by concerns associated with climate change, is seen
as an important complement to the decarbonization of the economy, and for meeting the increased demand for food produced more sustainably. Also consumers are better informed and inclined to buy environmentally friendly products. 
These changes create opportunities for the utilization of biomass to increase recycling and to shorten supply chains, feedstock for the production of numerous materials from fuels/energy to chemicals, bioplastics, pharmaceuticals, among others.

The bioeconomy concept as a development approach has similarities and differences with concepts of the circular and green economies, which are included as approaches to sustainable development.
All are multidimensional concepts, having as goals: the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy and material use efficiency, responsible consumption, the importance of social inclusion and the relevance of innovation.
