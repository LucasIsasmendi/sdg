### In the age of pandemics, connecting food systems and health: a Global One Health approach

Local, regional and global food security are affected by the occurrence of epidemics of zoonotic infectious diseases, caused by pathogens that spillover from animals to humans. Currently, this is clearly illustrated by the COVID-19 crisis.

A One Health approach embraces the notion that the health of animals, people, plants and the environment are inextricably connected. Conversely, climate change, urbanization and mobility innovations should evaluate the risk for new and (re-)emerging human, animal and plant pathogens. 

Here, we discuss the link between global food security and healthy people, animals, plants and environment, and how we can better prepare for, and minimize the chance of, future pandemics. We conclude that both public and private parties should strengthen their One Health approach to jointly realize resilient and strong global health and agri-food systems.
