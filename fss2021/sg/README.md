## Healthy diet: A definition for the United Nations Food Systems Summit 2021 (March 2021)
Diets are combinations of foods consumed by individuals of a given time. The specific combination of foods that make up healthy diets, however, is context specific and depends on many cultural, economic, and other factors.

### Definition  
A healthy diet is health-promoting and disease-preventing. It provides adequacy without excess, of nutrients and health promoting substances from `nutritious foods` and avoids the consumption of `health-harming substances`.

### *Annex 1: Defining nutritious foods*
#### *The distinction between diets and foods*

Diets are the combination of foods consumed over time, through which we achieve adequacy without excess of all nutrients (including energy). Foods that make up a healthy diet should be safe, and nutritious.

> A nutritious food is “one that provides beneficial nutrients (e.g. protein, vitamins, minerals, essential amino acids, essential fatty acids, dietary fibre) and minimizes potentially harmful elements (e.g. antinutrients, quantities of sodium, saturated fats, sugars)”

While conceptually simple, there is no straightforward, universally accepted approach to classifying individual foods as more or less nutritious. Similarly, some context specificity is required in the categorization of individual foods as nutritious. The same food, for example, whole fat milk, may provide much-needed energy and other nutrients to one population group (e.g., underweight 3-year-old children), but be less “healthy” for another due to high energy (calories) and fat content (e.g., obese adults).

`Nutrient profiling` or the rating of foods based on their nutrient density (i.e., nutrient content per 100 g or per 100 kcal of energy or per serving) has evolved substantially in recent years as an approach to classifying individual foods as more or less nutritious. Recent efforts have also proposed more complete profiling approaches that, in addition to nutrient density, take into consideration the food groups of ingredients (e.g., fruit or vegetable content), and further develop the content of ingredients (e.g., types of fat) that should be limited. To date, nutrient-profiling has been used predominantly for packaged foods in many high-income and several middle-income countries. Considerable limitations remain for extending its utility to unpackaged foods and in contexts where a large portion of food is not commercially produced (💻).

#### *Several evidence gaps and controversies that influence our ability to characterize health diets and nutritious foods:*

- **Imperfect characterization of population nutrient requirements to avoid deficiency and promote health**: Estimated average requirements are developed and converted into recommended daily nutrient intake levels that will ensure that the requirements of 95% of the population are met. Some experts are now calling for additional research to estimate requirements using a consistent approach. Emerging evidence suggests that eventually, dietary recommendations may be personalized to optimize human health outcomes based on individual characteristics, but science is still far from achieving this goal.

- **Lack of consensus and standardized definitions related to food processing and health implications**: A growing body of evidence suggests that highly processed foods (or ultra- processed foods) are human health-harming. Recent studies have also highlighted the impact of such foods on the environment. Urgent consensus is needed on how to classify such foods, define food processing categories and operationalize the implications for the private sector.

### *Annex 2: Avoiding consumption of health-harming substances*
#### Bringing safety to the definition of healthy diets:
Food safety refers to “all those hazards, whether chronic or acute, that may make food injurious to the health of the consumer”
The FERG/WHO report quantified the burden of disease from the most critical food borne toxins (aflatoxin, cassava cyanide and dioxins).
Some work has also been done to estimate the burden of illness due to four food-borne metals (arsenic, cadmium, lead, methylmercury), which is estimated to be substantial. As with nutrition, our evidence related to food safety and health continues to evolve. For example, the clinical outcome of exposure to food-borne pathogens may be modulated by the human gut microbiome.

Food safety system performance and related disease outcomes are predominantly utilised in high-income countries (HICs). `Food safety` ensures that food is fit for human consumption and not harmful to human health and is most often under the competence of veterinary, health or agricultural inspectors. `Food quality` is a market category that is usually the responsibility of food or market inspectors

#### Several evidence gaps and controversies that influence the ability to assess and ensure the safety of foods as part of a healthy diet:
- **Food safety has complex interactions with other societal concerns**: In many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), food is often purchased from traditional markets close to the point of production and undergoes limited transformation
- **The preferred method for improving food safety and quality is preventive, and many but not all potential food hazards can be controlled along the food chain**. Engaging the food industry at all levels to understand their role in preventing food contamination through the application of good practices, i.e., good agricultural practices (GAP), good manufacturing practices (GMP), good hygienic practices (GHP), and the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point system (HACCP) is challenging. (💻) In addition to HACCP, the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) sets standards to address the safety and nutritional quality of foods for most segments of the food chain to protect consumer health and fair practices. The CAC establishes standards for maximum levels of food additives, limits for contaminants and toxins, and residue limits for pesticides and veterinary drugs.
- **Some countries, especially LMIC, have not adopted modern food safety control systems even though there is a significant burden of food-related illness**

### Approaches to translating healthy diet into specific food-based recommendations
1. observed dietary patterns in populations where certain diseases, usually non-communicable diseases (NCDs), appear less prevalent. Example: Mediterranean diet. They do not consider all potential health outcomes.
2. quantify the specific dietary intake patterns associated with multiple outcomes - both human and environmental or planetary health. Principles to guide a `sustainable, healthy diet`, based primarily on eating local and minimizing processed food were published as early as 1986.
     - 🔬: EAT-Lancet Commission on Healthy Diets from Sustainable Food Systems
3. The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified a series of guiding principles for healthy diets that seek to address all forms of malnutrition and related health issues: `food-based dietary guidelines` (FBDG).
    - 📓: Sustainable healthy diets: guiding principles (FAO & WHO)
    - 📗: Nutrition and Food Systems. Report No.12

### Conclusion
This brief defines a healthy diet for the Food Systems Summit, placing human health-promotion and disease-prevention at the center. In doing so, we draw attention to food safety. Without ensuring safety, diets cannot nourish and instead will cause illness.

There will always be tensions between the indicative or guiding principles and approaches that propose more quantified recommendations. The former leaves much room for interpretation. The latter tends to underestimate the complexities of extrapolating prescribed diets to varying age, sex, life-stage, culture, food availability, affordability, among other considerations. 

The FAO and WHO have now set out a series of guiding principles to achieve contextually appropriate sustainable, affordable, healthy diets (15,16)

## Food Systems – Definition, Concept and Application for the UN Food Systems Summit (March 2021) 

`Transformation` is a never-ending process in food systems. `Transition` is the movement from one state to another. And `evolution` is the process of change. These are not interchangeable terminologies. Most food systems need all three. 

The food system is largely structured by private sector actors, including farmers, food manufacturers, traders, retailers, or food service businesses. 
Nature-Positive Production, `nature positive`, imply a narrative that may be surprising and new, not rooted in the established research literature or in terminology of SDGs. 
the Food Systems Summit needs to be open to new thinking, to new concepts, and to establishing new institutional and organizational arrangements. Addressing symptoms of systems failures will not be sufficient. 

The five Action Tracks capture various key opportunities and challenges of food systems and relate to one or more food systems components, but they do not define a food systems concept as such. Therefore, the pursuit of the Action Tracks needs to be conscious of an overarching food systems concept. Pursuing each in isolation from the others would lead to inefficient solution proposals that neglect system-wide effects. 
The Tracks should better be understood as **interlinked Action Areas**. 

### Considering Culture and Values
Survey shows whether they think protecting the environment should be the priority, or whether economic growth and jobs should be prioritized. There are differences. This hints at the challenges of finding consensus among and within countries on food systems actions. 

For transformative policy approaches to be acceptable they will need to take into account values and cultural traditions. 

### Main Objectives 
The Action Tracks need a systems frame that defines sustainable food systems that deliver health and nutrition within the scope of the following three objectives: 
1. **End hunger** and achieve **healthy diets** for all. It is important to understand the interactions between diets, health systems, and food systems to make progress towards the SDGs and their related targets in agriculture, inequality, poverty, sustainable production, consumption, nutrition, and health. 
2. **sustainable use of biodiversity and natural resources**, the **protection of ecosystems** and the safeguarding of land, oceans, forests, freshwater, and climate 
3. Eliminate poverty and increase income and wealth. Changing food systems need to ensure that people with a low income can access a healthy diet by enabling them to earn living wages.

In addition, reduction of risks and the fostering of **food systems’ resilience** 

### Concluding Remarks 
Food systems transformation has to have a perspective on where we want to be headed. We then need to understand what is entailed in the transition to desirable food systems, and how to facilitate the evolution of such food systems. Thus, a vision for food systems transformation is required, and pursued with a strong sense of urgency.

## The True Cost and True Price of Food (June 1, 2021)
One of the central problems of current food systems is that many of the costs of harmful foods are externalized, i.e. are not reflected in market prices (it will be 3x expensive). At the same time, the benefits of healthful foods are not appreciated. Due to externalities, sustainable and healthy food is often less affordable to consumers and profitable for businesses than unsustainable and unhealthy food. 

More studies are needed to quantify the costs and benefits of food systems to support a global shift to more sustainable and healthy diets. We need a system reset to account for these `hidden costs` in food systems and calls for bold actions to redefine food prices and the incentives for producing and consuming healthier and more sustainable diets. 

1. redefine the value of food through `True Cost Accounting (TCA)` to address externalities and other market failures, revealing the costs of damage to the environment and human health.
2. `true pricing`: incorporating externalities in prices to align market incentives with social values. Appropriate safety nets to boost consumer purchasing power and the enforcement of rights and regulations

### Introduction
Ensuring sustainable food systems entails ensuring that food systems provide affordable and healthy food to all people while respecting planetary and social boundaries. Current food systems are not sustainable.

Increasing the consumption of healthy, protective foods such as fruits and vegetables, legumes, nuts and seeds will address multiple health-related issues.

The economic value of food, which drives economic choices by businesses, consumers and governments, is highly distorted.

### The externalities as barriers to sustainable food systems
Externalities refer to "situations when the effect of production or consumption of goods and services imposes costs or benefits on others which are not reflected in the prices charged for the goods and services being provided". 
For example, greenhouse gas emissions from one person’s actions affect people far away and future generations who have no say in those decisions. Externalities can also be beneficial, such as disease prevention that lowers health care costs.
In addition, to monopoly and monopsony, a lack of information or behavioral biases, can lead consumers to ignore costs and benefits of their decisions. 

Externalities create significant problems in food systems: environmental, social, health, economic.

The first problem is that externalities prevent societies from achieving their full potential by distorting the information about the value of food conveyed by market prices. The market price of products does not reflect its true costs and benefits. Also, the value of companies and their decisions reflect expected future profits (cost of outputs - inputs). If a company contributes to climate change, underpays workers or enables healthy and affordable food, this is not reflected in its profit. The financial value of investments does not reflect the actual value that these investments benefit society.
The degree to which the food systems contribute to climate change, deforestation or poor health is not factored into crucial economic indicators for policymakers, like GDP.

A second problem with (negative) externalities is social injustice.
The erosion of natural capital breaches the rights of future generations to decent livelihoods.

The third problem with externalities is that they inadvertently reward unsustainable, unaffordable and unhealthy food production and consumption. As natural, health and social costs are externalised, it is more profitable to produce unsustainable and unhealthy food.
At the same time, adding calories, salt, poor quality fats, sugars and harmful sugar alternatives to food items and promoting such foods can increase sales despite the negative effects on health.
In the same way, encouraging high levels of food waste, e.g. through appealing packaging, can increase sales. Moreover, firms have no incentive to make healthy food affordable.
Businesses set prices to optimize their business profit, sometimes using inflated prices as signals of healthy food. As a result, sustainable and healthy food is more expensive to buy than unhealthy food.

Given that global capital markets allocate capital based on financial returns, most capital will flow to the most successful companies in externalising costs to optimize profit.
In an economy where consumers maximize purchasing power, businesses maximize profits, investors maximize returns, the result is underproduction of food leading to waste, overuse of natural resources and overconsumption of unhealthy food.

In summary, externalities form a significant barrier to the transition to sustainable food systems. It is difficult to imagine how policies aiming to foster sustainable food systems will be successful in an economic system where the erosion of natural capital, breaches of human rights, and unhealthy food are permissible and strongly incentivized.

### True Cost Accounting (TCA): Redefining the value of food
A first step to address externalities is to expose them and redefine the value of food by TCA: a tool for the systemic measurement and valuation of environmental, social, health and economic costs and benefits to facilitate sustainable choices by governments and food system stakeholders

TCA can serve different purposes, where different actors have different applications:
- Governments: integration into local, national or regional policy and budgeting
- Businesses: use assessments to minimize negative impacts and enhance positive benefits across value chains
- Financial institutions: reporting, impact investment and risk assessment
- Farmers: means to account for the costs and benefits of their agricultural practices 
- Consumers: become aware of the environmental and social externalities embedded in the food they buy

TCA recognises that the economy's productive assets go beyond the assets currently accounted for and include natural, social and human capital. Typically starts by identifying the goal and scope of the assessment, establishing the unit of analysis and the system boundaries.

The quantification of carbon emissions is relatively mature, whereas the quantification of health externalities is quite young and involves substantial uncertainty. There is limited information available at this scale due to the young nature of TCA, the complexity of food chains and the large variety of disciplines and data required. 

### Redesigning the economics of food: True pricing
Once we understand the true cost of food, food system transformation requires a redesign of the economics of food through true pricing - the integration of externalities in prices. 
True pricing can incentivise the private sector to provide more beneficial externalities from healthy, sustainable food production and consumption. 

Challenge - putting theory into practice: how to reliably measure, trace and account for externalities throughout the entire value chain of food products.
Recent advances in digital technology, environmental science and economics may allow businesses and governments to apply TCA and true pricing: up-to-date primary and real-time data, sensor technologies, tracing, blockchain, Big data.

Citizens and consumers are interested in externalities. The majority of people are not selfish but have (conditional) pro-social preferences and are interested in sustainability, but price plays a foundational consideration in consumption choices.
Government intervention and international frameworks and agreements are likely required to fully internalise externalities.
However, international trade regulations are a constraint to such change. The World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules impose economic competition strictly based on prices and do not consider externalities.

We need structural changes to higher productivity, sustainable and skill-intensive activities.
Agroecological systems are more likely to provide diversified food (contributing to healthy diets) with a lower environmental footprint. However, in some cases, organic farms have relatively large emissions of GHGs per unit product.

First-best true pricing mechanisms could support fully sustainable food systems. However, there are still substantial technological and political constraints to implement them:
- Technology to collect and trace externalities along the value chain
- Modernising the implementation of fiscal systems
- Integrating true pricing into international trade agreements
- Creating popular understanding and support for true pricing

Second-best policies effectively incentivise sustainable, healthy and affordable food without imposing significant administrative burdens or complexities.
A 10% decrease in price increased the consumption of healthful foods by 13%.

### Estimating the true costs of food systems in the context of the UNFSS aspirations
Vast majority of environmental externalities are in the primary process. 
The annual true cost of food for the globe is 3.2 times higher that the current cost at market prices.

Among the highest environmental costs are GHG emissions leading to climate change; land use and land-use change leading to loss of ecosystems and biodiversity, and air pollution leading to, amongst others, loss of biodiversity and human health.
Note that the health costs are borne by the current population, whereas a significant part of the environmental costs will be carried by future generations.
Quantifying and valuing the health impacts of diets is a novel field. Currently, no quantified dietary guide is available to support the analysis of achieving the ambitions of the UNFSS. 

### Potential benefits of transitions to more sustainable diets
Effective policy interventions to redesign the economics of food also require an understanding of the effects of possible transitions on environmental and health externalities as well as affordability. 
The EAT-Lancet pescatarian, vegetarian and vegan diets offer a comparison to a healthy reference diet.

### Towards science-based and pragmatic true pricing mechanisms
In a fully sustainable food system, all people can afford healthy and sustainable food. If the damage to nature is paid for and restored in a sustainable food system, food production costs will increase providing an incentive to reduce the environmental footprint.

### Recommendations
In the short term, policymakers can remove the barriers for stakeholders to engage in TCA and use TCA data to redefine the value of food to reflect its true costs and benefits. In particular, governments and other UNFSS stakeholders can:
- Foster internationally accepted harmonized TCA principles across all applications
- Educate and build capacity among professionals in business and government about TCA
- Provide professionals in business and governments with concrete tools to facilitate TCA

In the medium and long term, governments can look at ways to integrate TCA in economic metrics at all levels systematically:
- National Accounts and GDP
- business sustainability reporting and controls
- product labelling

### Annex 1: How does True Cost Accounting work?
A TCA assessment can be done at different levels: a food system, a policy, a region, an organisation, an investment or a product. For each type of analysis, various frameworks exist.
A TCA assessment starts by defining the goal, scope and unit of analysis (functional unit). The relevant externalities have to be identified and assessed, qualitatively or quantitatively. Quantification starts with measuring or assessing inputs and outputs, the direct measurable effects of production and consumption. Outputs have to be translated to impacts via impact pathways.
The final quantification step is the attribution of impact to the functional unit (CO2-equivalents, litres of scarce blue water, etc).

After externalities have been quantified, they can be valued, in monetary terms or otherwise, so that they are expressed in a common unit. To capture value not reflected in market prices, a TCA assessment requires an implicit or explicit measure of welfare (well-being, income, living wage, environmental limits).

## Track 1
**`Ensuring Access to Safe and Nutritious Food for All Through Transformation of Food Systems (March 2021)`**

The COVID pandemic has exacerbated malnutrition and highlighted the need for food safety. The pandemic has also exposed the deep inequalities in society and food systems.
Structural change is necessary to address the socio-economic drivers behind malnutrition, inequalities and the climate and environmental impacts of food.
Adopting a whole-system approach in policy, research and monitoring and evaluation is crucial to manage trade-off and externalities from farm-level to national scales and across multiple sectors and agencies.

Shifting to more sustainable consumption and production patterns within planetary boundaries will require efforts to influence food demand and diets, diversify food systems, careful land-use planning and management. Integrative policies need to ensure that food prices reflect real costs (including major externalities caused by climate change, land degradation and biodiversity loss, and public health impacts of malnutrition), reduce food waste and, at the same time, ensure safe and healthy food affordability, decent incomes and wages for farmers and food system workers.

### 1. Introduction
Food systems encompass all the elements and activities that relate to the production, processing, distribution, preparation and consumption of food, as well as the output of these activities, including socio-economic and environmental outcomes

### 2. What is a safe and nutritious diet?
> A safe and nutritious diet is a healthy diet – a diet that “is human health-promoting and disease-preventing. It provides adequacy (without an excess of nutrients) and health-promoting substances from nutritious foods and avoids the consumption of health-harming substances”

Safe food promotes health and is free of foodborne diseases.

Malnutrition includes undernourishment, micronutrient deficiencies and overweight (including obesity). Malnutrition increases susceptibility to foodborne diseases, creating a vicious cycle for health, reducing productivity and compromising development. The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to increase the risk of all forms of malnutrition.

While the definitions of an adequate diet and safe food are established and widely accepted, there is debate in the literature about what constitutes a sustainable diet. Each proposed diet has trade-offs in terms of affordability, climate and environmental impacts. These trade-offs are discussed in the sections that follow.

### 3. We are not on track to meet international targets for ensuring safe and nutritious food for all by 2030
No country is exempt from the scourge of malnutrition. Undernutrition coexists with overweight, obesity and other diet-related non-communicable diseases (NCDs), even in poor countries. 
37% of overweight children reside in low and middle-income countries.
Inequalities in society and the food system make affordable and healthy diets inaccessible to the most vulnerable populations. There is an urgent need to transform food systems to deliver on nutrition outcomes.
The consumption of unsafe foods cost low- and middle-income countries at least US$ 110 billion in lost productivity and medical expenses annually. With a large proportion of emerging human infectious diseases originating from animal sources (zoonotic diseases), there is also an increasing need to consider both animal and human health as a 'One Health' issue.

### 4. Interconnected food systems drivers that affect the access to safe and nutritious food for all
The drivers and the food system are influenced by globalisation and the global COVID-19 pandemic. In certain contexts, the drivers and the food system are also affected by conflict and fragility.

`Food system -> Production -> Harvesting -> Processing -> Consumption`
- **Socio-economic drivers**: population growth, westernization of diets, increased food waste and overweight, increased demand for animal-sourced foods in diets leading to increased demand of feed from arable crops, rapid urbanisation. These trends could cause a doubling of food demand by 2050.
  - `Globalisation`: Lockdowns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic's of zoonotic origin have disrupted the production, transportation, and sale of nutritious, fresh and affordable foods, forcing millions of families to rely on nutrient-poor alternatives. Globalized food trade can also contribute to unsustainable water use and to land degradation.
  - `Demography and urbanization`: Although population growth has slowed globally, the population in the 47 least developed countries (mostly in Africa and Asia) is projected to double between 2019 and 2050. Nevertheless, in 2018, for the first time in history, the proportion of older persons (above 65) outnumbered children under five years – a trend that is predicted to continue. A growing proportion of older people will put a strain on the health system and change nutritional needs and dietary preferences. Moreover, by 2050, 68% of the global population could be urban, shifting the proportion of producers to consumers, changing consumption patterns (demand), driving land take and putting extra pressure on soil resources
  - `Poverty and inequality`: Poverty traps millions in poor nutrition, depriving them of their potential. The prevalence of undernutrition and overweight adults are directly linked with relative food prices.**Healthy diets cost between 60 and 400% more than nutrient adequate and energy sufficient diets, respectively.** More than 1.5 billion people cannot afford a nutrient-adequate diet and over three billion cannot afford even the cheapest healthy diet. Food system disruptions caused by COVID measures aggravate this situation.  Under and malnourishment costs 3% of global GDP and overweight and obesity another 2% of GDP
  - `Conflict and fragility`: Government and political institutions (municipalities, legal systems and political party structures) have not adapted to the social fabric they presently govern, constraining development and also affecting development and the delivery of humanitarian aid. The provision of food transfers in emergency situations may alter the food preferences of communities, leading to changes in production and consumption past-conflict. The largest numbers of acutely food-insecure people are in Africa. Adverse climate events and stresses compound violence, displacement and disrupted agriculture and trade. Often those affected by crises flee to neighbouring countries, putting additional stress on the international humanitarian response system and on the food systems of the host countries.
- **Supply chain failures and underutilized technologies**:
  - The focus of food supply has shifted over the past few decades from `feeding the world` to `nourishing the world`, but technological advancements still lack behind and many supply-side factors and failures affect the ability of the food system to sustainably ensure access to safe and nutritious for all.
  - More than half of the calories consumed by humans are provided by three major cereal crops (rice, maize, and wheat).
  - While efficiency and substitution are steps towards sustainable intensification, system redesign may be essential for agro-ecological intensification through e.g. integrated pest management, conservation agriculture, integrated crop and biodiversity, pasture and forage, trees, irrigation management and small or patch systems
  - Currently, **25-30% of total food produced is lost or wasted** throughout the food chain. They constrain food system sustainability due to their adverse effects on food security, natural resources, environment, climate and human health (e.g., toxic emissions from incineration)
  - Plant biotechnologies are mostly used for fibre and animal feed, less often for food because of regulatory constraints and intellectual property rights barriers 
  - New and innovative technologies such as biotechnologies, precision agriculture and digital agriculture, alternative protein sources, underutilized food sources and the use of biomass for bioenergy and green chemicals need to be harnessed to improve food systems. However, such advances can also drive negative food system changes. For example, biofuel production based on grains from food crops, can drive up staple food prices and compete for land, exacerbating inequalities.
- **Climate change, land-use change and natural resource degradation**: 
  - Diets and cropping patterns may change as climate factors constrain the production of traditionally grown crops.
  - With increasing warming, the frequency, intensity and duration of heatwaves, droughts and extreme rainfall events are projected to increase in most world regions, increasingly threatening the stability of food supply (4°C warming ≈ 86% probability of losses, 2°C warming ≈ 7% probability of losse)
  - Where adaptation possibilities are limited, this may substantially change their global availability, affordability and consumption in the mid- to long-term
  - The nutritional quality of crops may also be affected by rising atmospheric CO2 levels through reduced proteins and micro-nutrients contents
  - Labour productivity is also likely to reduce with increasing temperatures
  - The global food system (from farm inputs to consumers) emits about 30% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHG), contributes to 80% of tropical deforestation and is a main driver of land degradation and desertification, water scarcity and biodiversity decline
  - By 2050 land degradation and climate change could lead to a reduction of global crop yields by about 10% with strong negative impacts in India, China and sub-Saharan Africa resulting in the displacement of up to 700 million people
  - Around 2 billion people live within watersheds exposed to water scarcity and this number could double by 2050
  - Future agricultural productivity in the tropics is also at risk from a deforestation-induced increase in mean temperature and the associated heat extremes and from a decline in rainfall
  - Over half of the tropical forests worldwide have been destroyed since the 1960s, affecting the lives of 1 billion poor people whose livelihoods depend on forests and equalling a mass extinction event if tropical deforestation continues unabated

### 5. Transforming food systems is key to safe and nutritious food for all
Business as usual is not an option with the future of food and nutrition security in jeopardy. Changing the path of our future will demand a structural transformation (transitioning from low productivity and labour-intensive economic activities to higher productivity, sustainable and skill-intensive activities) of food systems.
This will require changes in the allocation of resources and research attention to factors beyond production will be necessary to transition to more sustainable patterns of production and consumption. More concerted effort is needed to coordinate activities, monitor progress more closely and greater accountability from all players across the food system.

Priority should be given to the establishment of functional problem-solving institutions which address the core challenges facing each of the various components of the global food systems.

A global social compact (an implicit agreement among the members of a society to cooperate for social benefits) is needed to manage the demand and consumption drivers and harness science, technology and innovation to improve the sustainable production of enough food to ensure access to affordable, safe and nutritious foods for all.
Levers for change:
- **Coordination, monitoring and accountability**: UN agencies and their partners have converged through various mechanisms for food security coordination. 
  - Strengthening the global governance and accountability with regards to safe and nutritious food for all and to sustainable food systems is key for meeting the challenges ahead and will require cross-sectoral integration of policies.
  - Improved coordination, monitoring and accountability across the food system and among all stakeholders is necessary, including sharing knowledge, building capacity, better measurement, updated data, better modelling for foresight, scenarios and case studies and access to documented success stories. 
  - Integrated, science-based policies (health and nutrition, food and agriculture, climate and environment) would allow to reinforce accountability both at national and international scales. 
  - Advances in information technology and data science play an important role in enabling rapid assessment of situations, monitoring and decision making and adaptive learning. An integrated global food system model is needed. Moreover, improved indicators of food systems are required
    - 📗: The state of food security and nutrition in the world - 2020.pdf
  - Rigorous global monitoring systems require global collaboration, updated information, and investment with significant returns. The monitoring of underlying systemic risks as well as food system indicators is essential to identify threats/pressure at an earlier stage.
  - A task force charged with global monitoring and data collection opportunities about agri-food systems, could provide a clearinghouse for the multiple (often duplicated) data held by UN agencies and public and private organisations.
  - Two-way real-time and artificial intelligence applications to collect information of systemic risks and food systems and disseminate information to various stakeholders and beneficiaries are needed in last-mile and crises situations and in regions disproportionately affected by the Covid-19 pandemic food system disruptions.
- **Influencing food demand and dietary changes**: There are several ways to reduce demand on the global food system both in the short and long-term and make nutritious foods more available and affordable. Some of these ways may be by accelerating demographic transitions, increasing incomes, reducing food losses and waste and changing diets.
  - Household food waste is proliferating in emerging economies and is likely to increase without deliberate effort to curb waste
    - 📓: Implications for food prices, production and resource use
  - The amount of food waste/loss varies greatly from region to region, therefore, context specific interventions are crucial
  - Private investment is needed to develop food processing, refrigeration, storage, warehousing as well as retail markets to reduce food waste.
  - Vertical integration of food chains can shorten chains to the benefit of smallholder farmers while trade can expand market opportunities.
  - Because of the strong associations between female education, fertility and infant mortality, alternative education scenarios alone lead to a difference of more than one billion people in the world population sizes projected for 2050 and could therefore reduce the rise in food demand.
  - Balanced diets, featuring plant-based foods complemented by animal-sourced food produced in resilient, sustainable and low-GHG emission systems present major opportunities for adaptation and mitigation of climate change while generating significant co-benefits in terms of human health
  - most diets have trade-offs between nutritional values, affordability and environmental issues
    - 📃: The relative caloric prices of healthy and unhealthy foods 2019
  - Many highly nutritious foods may simply be unaffordable to poorer populations and displaced by cheap, nutrient-poor foods. Moreover, a balance is necessary between meeting the demand for diversified, nutritious and affordable food and minimizing the time and energy to prepare meals.
  - Policy options could be used to manage food demand, shift consumption patterns, reduce the environmental footprint of food systems and ensure equity across the food system.
  - Policies that enable healthy food environments (such as sugar taxes, educational food labelling, reducing salt, the prohibition of trans-fats and a reduction in the use of high-fructose corn syrup) are core to improving food environments and limiting the burden of non-communicable diseases.
  - subsidies on fortified foods can have positive nutritional effects, and in-kind transfers may limit food deficits during periods of currency or price volatility. However, price subsidies and in-kind assistance have complex interactions on markets and purchasing decisions with both negative implications and benefits
    - 📃: Leveraging Social Protection Programs for Improved Nutrition 2016
- **Shifting to more sustainable consumption and production within planetary boundaries**: There are more than 570 million farms worldwide, most of which are small and family-operated. 
  - Targeted policies that focus on the farmer may incentivise positive changes in landscapes, production diversity and dietary diversity.
  - diversification in the food system can enhance adaptation to increased climate variability under climate change.
  - Diversified agroecological systems can play a role in meeting health and nutrition goals while also reducing environment-related health risks caused by conventional agriculture through water and air pollution, and more specifically by pesticides, antibiotics and inorganic fertilizers
  - Compared to conventional agriculture, organic agriculture generally has a positive effect on a range of environmental factors, but it has weaknesses in terms of lower productivity and reduced yield stability
  - Sustainable land management can bridge yield gaps and avoid deforestation while providing climate change adaptation and mitigation and land degradation co-benefits in croplands and pastures. This can be achieved by increasing soil organic carbon, agroforestry, erosion and fire control, improved irrigation water and fertilizers management, heat and drought tolerant plants 
    - 📃: Which practices co‐deliver food security, climate change mitigation and adaptation, and combat land degradation and desertification? 2020
  - Under stringent global climate change mitigation policy, risks for food security would be increased through competition for land between food production, bioenergy and afforestation be it driven by local or foreign investment in land. Nevertheless, increasing and valuing soil carbon sequestration on agricultural land would allow the reduction of these negative impacts by approximately two thirds.
  - Increased demand for fish and seafood has threatened fisheries and the sustainability of ocean resources.
  - Ensuring that food prices reflect real costs, including major externalities caused by climate change, land and water resources degradation and biodiversity loss is necessary to address artificial price distortions, reduce food waste, internalize the costs of externalities (including the public health impacts) and, at the same time, ensure decent incomes and wages for farmers and food system workers.
  - a true costing of food would on average increase food prices. Food assistance policies that do not distort market and labour incentives can meet emergency food needs and improve access to food. Trade can help improve food availability, diversify diets and smooth price volatility
- **Harnessing science and innovation and managing risks**: Science should increasingly inform solutions and generate knowledge that is actionable to transform food systems and reach safe and nutritious for all. 
  - Since policy agendas are largely set at national and local scales, the translation of global-scale scientific assessments into actionable knowledge at national and local scales is needed.
  - New and emerging technologies appropriate for one health, climate change adaption and mitigation, as well as disaster preparedness, could be game-changers for overcoming challenges and building system resilience.
  - Evidence-based assessment is needed of the risks and benefits associated with new technologies. 
  - Research is also needed to understand the diffusion modes of traditional knowledge and social innovations to support the conservation of common goods in more participatory, collaborative, inclusive and equitable ways.
  - investments in science-based (genome editing, digital agriculture, vertical farming, alternative protein sources, agroecology, blockchain, AI, Big Data), participatory processes to map out realistic and equitable options are needed
  - Global and regional data sharing systems (including machine learning) based on the `FAIR principles` (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable data) can advance food systems knowledge and enhance the accountability of all stakeholders of the food systems. 
  - The use of open-source platforms for data and code sharing should be encouraged to stimulate global learning.
  - The upcoming Countdown on Food System Transformation mechanism may support the effort to bring together various indicators in a systematic framework for monitoring and evaluation.
  - risk assessment tools will be needed to drive food safety policy and standards and to optimize surveillance, detection and early warning systems of zoonotic diseases for both the formal and informal sectors and crop diseases.
  - Modernizing our food safety and biosecurity risk management systems is an integral part of the food system transformation required to meet food and nutrition security needs. This will require a science- and risk-based approach for production of safe food within a food systems approach.
- **Peace and resilience**
- **COVID-19 recovery**

### 6. Concluding messages
- Action to address safety, malnutrition, poverty and inequality, as well as climate and environmental issues, through food systems transformation will undoubtedly bring large health, social, economic, ecological and development co-benefits and savings on public expenditure while supporting several interrelated SDGs.
- A range of priority actions to speed up progress towards international targets and scale up the solutions proposed in section 5 can be taken in the short-term, based on existing knowledge, while supporting longer, more sustainable responses with significant co-benefits. Future actions will have to be iterative, coherent, adaptive and flexible to maximise co-benefits and minimise trade-offs.
- Adopting a whole-system approach in policy, research and monitoring and evaluation is crucial to manage trade-off and externalities from farm-level to national scales and across multiple sectors and agencies. Ultimately, context matters and comprehensive national action plans are crucial for setting out actions suited to the particular economic, agricultural, social and dietary preferences of the particular nation.
- Careful consideration of the trade-offs and co-benefits of any actions will be necessary at different levels (sub-national, national, regional and global).
- Likewise, there may be ‘winners’ and ‘losers’ in each action adopted to transform to more sustainable food systems. The losses and gains will vary depending on the context but could include a loss of income and livelihoods across the food system - such as would happen with a reduction in the production and consumption of animal-sourced foods or the implementation of seasonal banning of fishing to allow for the regeneration of marine resources. Including all stakeholders in discussions, policy-making and evaluation processes is essential for the inclusive transformation of food systems at all levels.
- Adaptive learning and new knowledge must be shared globally to accelerate our capacities to meet existing and future challenges.
- Improved international cooperation and coordination of the food system is necessary, including the establishment of a comprehensive monitoring, evaluation and early warning system with comprehensive indicators, transparency and commitments of all stakeholders.
- More research is needed to identify the most adequate, affordable, healthy and sustainable diets across different contexts. 
- More frequently collected nutrition and poverty data are necessary to provide more data points for monitoring change and progress.
- Innovative indicators such as the affordability of adequate, nutritious and healthy diets are vital to bring the three elements of safety, nutrition and inequality together.
- The costs of acting and not acting on the key drivers of diet and food system change and the impact of these changes and shifts are required for effective decision making.
- Research and technology advances are essential to solve critical constraints and offer many opportunities to improve productivity, food safety and reduce food losses and waste, as well as GHG emissions.
- Capacity-building, property rights, technology development, transfer and deployment and enabling financial mechanisms across the food system can support livelihoods and increase incomes. Greater cooperation with regard to trade could overcome constraints and barriers.

Safe and nutritious food for all requires a transformation of food systems, changing both supply and demand of food in differentiated ways across world regions: bridging yield gaps and improving livestock feed conversion, largely through agro-ecological practices and agroforestry, deploying at scale soil carbon sequestration and agricultural greenhouse gas abatement, reducing food losses and wastes, as well as over-nourishment and changing the diets of wealthy populations. Global food systems sustainability also requires to halt the expansion of agriculture into fragile ecosystems while restoring degraded forests, fisheries, rangelands, peatlands and wetlands.

## Track 2
**`Shift to Healthy and Sustainable Consumption Patterns (April 2021)`**

Action Track 2 works to catalyse a shift in consumer behaviour that will create and build demand for sustainably produced agri‐ and ocean food products, strengthen shorter value chains, promote circular use of food resources, helping to reduce waste and improve nutrition, especially among the most vulnerable.

This Action Track recognises that current food consumption patterns, often characterised by higher levels of food waste and a transition in diets towards higher energy, more resource‐intensive foods, need to be transformed. 

By increasing food availability, lowering prices and increasing quality standards, they have also induced greater food waste at the consumer end. 

In addition, the risk of fast transmission of food‐borne disease, antimicrobial resistance and food‐related health risks throughout the food chain has increased, and the ecological footprint of the global food system continues to grow in terms of energy, resource use, and impact on climate change. 

Achieving healthy diets from sustainable food systems is complex and requires a multi‐pronged approach. Actions necessary include awareness‐raising, behaviour change interventions in food environments, food education, strengthened urban‐rural linkages, improved product design, investments in food system innovations, public private partnerships, public procurement, and separate collection enabling alternative uses of food waste can all contribute to this transition.

### 1. Introduction
Action Track 2 recognises that current food usage patterns, often characterised by high levels of food loss and waste, a high prevalence of the consumption of diets high in energy, and the production of natural resource‐intensive foods, need to be transformed to protect both people and the planet.

### 2. Building the evidence on healthy diets
A healthy diet is health‐promoting and disease‐preventing. It provides adequacy without excess, of nutrients and health promoting substances from nutritious foods and avoids the consumption of health‐harming substances.
It must supply adequate calories for energy balance, and include a wide variety of high quality and safe foods across a diversity of food groups to provide the various macronutrients, micronutrients and other food components needed to lead an active and healthy and enjoyable life.

Consumer demand, availability, affordability and accessibility are important drivers of dietary patterns. It is essential that these four aspects are considered simultaneously when pursuing dietary shifts.

National food-based dietary guidelines provide context-specific advice and principles on healthy diets and lifestyles, which are rooted on sound evidence, and respond to a country’s public health and nutrition priorities, food production and consumption patterns, sociocultural influences, food composition data, and accessibility, among other factors.

However, there can be wide variation in inclusion of and recommendations for other foods. Only 17% of food based dietary guidelines make specific recommendations about quantities of meat/egg/poultry/animal source food to consume (20% make specific recommendations about fish), and only three countries (Finland, Sweden and Greece) make specific quantitative recommendations to limit red meat. Only around a quarter of food based dietary guidelines recommend limiting consumption of ultra-processed foods, yet this is emerging as one of the most significant dietary challenges around the world.

Adherence with national food based dietary guidelines and recommendations around the world is low.
No regions globally have an average intake of fruits, whole grains, or nuts and seeds in line with recommendations and only central Asia meets the recommendations for vegetables. In contrast, the global (and several regional) average intake of red meat, processed meat and sugar‐sweetened beverages exceeds recommended limits.

###  3. Building the evidence on healthy diets from sustainable food systems
First and foremost, we need evidence on actual food consumption to consider shifts to dietary patterns that promote all dimensions of individuals’ health and wellbeing; have low levels of environmental pressure and impact; are accessible, safe and equitable; and are culturally acceptable.
Considering current environmental challenges, transitioning to food systems that can enhance natural ecosystems, rather than just sustain them, may be desirable.
- 📓 Sustainable healthy diets

The conceptual transition from healthy diets to healthy diets from sustainable food systems was mediated by recent studies linking food availability patterns, and projections, to non‐communicable disease health consequences, and the environmental impacts of food production. The most recent set of studies is embodied in the work of the EAT‐Lancet Commission on healthy diets from sustainable food systems.
These dietary recommendations diverge from most food based dietary guidelines, and often have lower ranges of inclusion of animal‐sourced foods. The authors then used six environmental dimensions of importance to planetary health and earth system processes (greenhouse gas emissions, cropland use, water use, nitrogen and phosphorus use and biodiversity), using the planetary boundaries concept, as boundary conditions for achieving a healthy diet from a sustainable food system.
  - 📓 Food in the Anthropocene: the EAT–Lancet Commission on healthy diets from sustainable food systems
  - 📋 A safe operating space for humanity

Flexitarian diets that allow for diversity of consumption options, including moderate meat consumption, would significantly reduce environmental impacts compared to baseline scenarios reflecting current consumption patterns.

The increases in fruits, nuts and vegetables needed more land, water and fertilisers, and therefore increases in productivity of cereals and legumes to bridge yield gaps by close to 75%, and reductions in waste of 50% would be needed for achieving the diets within all sustainability constraints.

The environmental footprint of foods, however, is strongly dependent on where foods are produced and how they are produced leaving significant room for innovation and improvement. Moreover, the adoption of any of the four alternative healthy diet patterns (flexitarian, pescatarian, vegetarian and the vegan diet) could potentially contribute to significant reductions of the social cost of greenhouse gas emissions, ranging from USD 0.8 to 1.3 trillion (50–74 percent).

Transitions towards healthy diets, let alone sustainable consumption are critical contributors to achieving climate stability, and halting the rampant loss of biodiversity. Combined actions on securing habitat for biodiversity, improving production practices, and better consumption would allow for halting biodiversity loss and bending the curve towards restoration by 2030.

There is also a financial case for shifting to healthy diets from sustainable food systems. There are hidden costs of our dietary patterns and of the food systems supporting them and two of the most important are the health (projected to exceed USD 1.3 trillion per year by 2030)‐ and climate‐related (projected to exceed USD 1.7 trillion per year by 2030) costs that the world incurs.

Shifting to healthy diets that include sustainability considerations would lead to an estimated reduction of up to 97 percent in direct and indirect health costs and reduce the social cost of greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated 41–74 percent in 2030.

The Global Nutrition Report 2020 demonstrated that of the 143 countries with comparable data, 124 have double or triple burden meaning that micronutrient deficiency is still prevalence in many developed countries demonstrating high levels of overweight/obesity.
In countries where the food system also drives the rural economy, care must be taken to mitigate the potential negative impacts on incomes and livelihoods as food systems transform to deliver affordable healthy diets.

Fish and fish products have one of the most eco‐efficient production profiles of all animal proteins.
Under optimistic projections, the ocean could produce up to six times more food than it does today—and it could do so with a low environmental footprint.

### 4. Transitioning to healthy diets from sustainable food systems
The evidence is abundantly clear, without shifts in consumption patterns towards health and sustainability we will fail to achieve multiple SDGs, we will fail to achieve the Paris Climate Agreement, the post 2020 biodiversity goals and we will lose the opportunity to reposition food to improve health and regenerate the environment.
Achieving these transitions and managing the trade‐offs and synergies will require additional attention to many facets of food systems, including:
- **Food environments**: the consumption of healthy diets from sustainable food sources is dependent on sustainably produced healthy dietary items being available, affordable and accessible in different outlets. The cost drivers of these diets are throughout the food supply chain, within the food environment, and in the political economy that shapes trade, public expenditure and investment policies
  - Policies that more generally foster behavioural change towards healthy diets will also be needed.
  - A critical challenge is the tremendous perishability of fruits and vegetables, particularly in tropical climates
  - In both urban and rural areas, the lack of physical access to food markets, especially to fresh fruit and vegetable markets, represents a formidable barrier to accessing a healthy diet, especially for the poor.
- **Addressing food safety issues across value chains**: Food safety is positioned at the intersection of agri‐food systems and health
  - Food safety across the value chains is to be ensured along all stages until consumption (from producers to processors, retailers and consumers)
  - Consumer behaviour at households in storing (temperature) and handling foods (cross contamination) impacts strongly on the onset of food borne intoxications.
  - The riskiest foods for biological hazards are livestock products followed by fish, fresh vegetables and fruit
  - Food safety management systems are designed to prevent, reduce or eliminate hazards along the food chain
  - Food safety control at primary production is achieved using good general hygiene practices.
  - Transitions to circular food systems, local food systems, or short circuit systems are often slowed or hampered by current food safety regulations.
  - FOA and WHO established the Codex Alimentarius Commission to address safety and nutritional quality of foods and develop international standards to promote trade among countries.
  - While metrics are considered key to monitoring and improving performance, they can also have unintended consequences and hard to implement, like traceability.
- **Local producers and value chains, income and land inequality**: for many consumers, local production is the main supplier of nutritious food and the primary provider of economic activity. The  transition to sustainable consumption requires support and value chain creation for linking food systems actors
  - It is important to provide support and transition options for potential losers impacted by the required changes to food systems
  - cities are playing more active roles in the development of city region food systems
  - Vertical farming could provide opportunities for increasing food production in urban areas
- **The role of trade in open and closed economies**:
  - Trade is an essential instrument in the food system, but it is not always geared towards sustainable consumption
  - trade in cheaper, ultra‐processed food with long shelf lives competes with healthy dietary items
  - removing trade protection across Central America would reduce the cost of nutritious diets by as much as 9% on average 
  - The efficiency of internal trade and marketing mechanisms is also important as these are key to reducing the cost of food to consumers and avoiding disincentives to the local production of nutritious foods.
- **The political economy of food**: While some large food companies are interested in opportunities for increasing their environmental sustainability, financial interests often prevail over sustainability concerns.
- **Modifying behavioural changes**:
  - Providing nutritional information was found to change the behaviour of consumers already interested in nutrition but was not able to influence consumers with low interest in nutrition.
  - Educational activities are more effective when used in in conjunction with environmental modifications, such as increasing the availability and accessibility of healthy dietary items
  - Altering food availability options can enhance healthy diets
  - the provision of financial incentives to make healthy diets more affordable has been shown to increase consumption of fruits and vegetables
  - Taxes and front‐of‐pack information labels have been used with success to moderate the purchase of unhealthy dietary items, as well as influence reformulation of unhealthy products
  - taxation and subsidy intervention influenced dietary behaviours to a moderate degree, they should be a minimum of 10 to 15% and should both be implemented to improve success and effect
- **Reducing food loss and waste and embracing circularity**: In low‐ and middle‐income countries, these losses occur mostly at the pre‐consumer stage due to harvest and storage losses while in OECD countries they are more significant at the consumption stage (dates)
  - Circular food systems have been suggested as a mechanism for reutilising these biomass streams

### 5. The key trade‐offs and synergies
The possibility of engaging in triple‐win actions linking health, consumption and the environment presents a real opportunity to achieve numerous global commitments simultaneously, which could be desirable from a policy perspective (SDGs 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 12‐16).
While potentially these synergies could lead to human and planetary wellbeing, their achievement could also yield significant trade‐offs that will require resolution. Some of these are related to the following dimensions:
- **Multiple environmental trade‐offs**: reductions in the demand for animal‐sourced foods could lead to reduced greenhouse gas emissions. It is only when consumption is modified, waste is reduced, and productivity increased that improvements across all environmental metrics are obtained.
- **Trade‐offs with affordability and availability**: the cheapest healthy diet costs 60 percent more than diets that only meet the requirements for essential nutrients. EAT‐Lancet diet are not affordable for an estimated 1.5 billion people. Healthy diets are unaffordable for more than 3 billion poor people in low‐, middle‐ and high‐income countries. In many cases, production of key dietary components does not meet the required demand, even at global level, and therefore their prices are high. Low market access (food desert: area with poor access to a retail outlet with fresh produce) can be a large barrier to achieving a healthy diet. Vertical farming may provide opportunities for food production in the future (after economic feasibility, codes, regulations and shared expertise)
- **Trade‐offs with pandemics and zoonosis**: In contexts where animal‐sourced food consumption is critical for maintaining appropriate intake of essential nutrients, it is vitally important to scale up a ONE HEALTH approach that enables environmental, animal, and human health. Today, the largest food source attributions in food borne intoxications is from food of animal origin in the developed world. Antimicrobial resistance contributes significantly to the burden of disease across the globe and constitutes a threat to public health.
- **Political economy trade‐offs**: Maintaining the status quo benefits the current actors of the food system, hence the inertia for change. The current system rewards economic efficiency rather than sustainability and the production of nutrition foods. Large private companies have a disproportionate control on the food agenda.

### 6. Solutions and actions
Solutions to enable the shift towards more sustainable consumption need to be defined around cross cutting levers connecting policy reform, coordinated investment, accessible financing, innovation, traditional knowledge, governance, data and evidence, and empowerment.
It is important to identify and learn from the success stories of individuals and groups that have shifted to healthy diets from sustainable food systems and to use these examples to clearly inform policymakers, practitioners and the public.

Range of critical actions necessary to effectively create transition towards healthy and sustainable diets:
  - 📗 Global Panel on Agriculture and Food Systems for Nutrition (Foresight-2.0)
- **Availability**: make sufficient nutrient-rich and staple foods available to all, produced sustainably
- **Accessibility**: ensure foods move along value chains more efficiently, improving accessibility and resulting in lower cost and less loss
- **Affordability**: ensure sustainable, healthy diets are affordable to all, with lower demand for ultra-processed products
- **Desirability**: empower consumers to make more informed food choices, fueling rising demand for sustainable, healthy diets

broader set of actions for implementation in different contexts:
- **Economic and structural costs**: associated with the transition to more healthy and sustainable diets.
  - Policies and investments across food supply chains
  - support and transition options for potential losers
  - Direct funding towards a healthy and sustainable food system
  - Facilitate easier access to loans
  - Piloting and scaling behaviour change interventions
  - Investing in innovative food related infrastructure and logistical systems
  - Break existing policy silos to facilitate food system transformations
- **Challenge the current political economy**:
  - penalization or taxes to encourage large food system actors to transition to the provision of healthy diets
  - incentives towards nutritious foods like fruits and vegetables
  - Promote social and environmental aspects of corporate performance to be equal to financial performance
  - limit the sale and production of unhealthy products
  - global regulatory to favour healthy diets from sustainable food systems
  - Promote divestment to avoid harm. This includes exclusion of certain companies from investment portfolios.
  - corporate responsibility investigate the level of sustainability of products
  - Encourage social impact investing
  - Empower consumers to demand for healthy, sustainable products and reject unhealthy products.
  - Encourage consumers to demand increased accountability for large food system actors.
  - Public institutions transition to healthier diets
  - 
- **Influencing consumer demand**: 
  - Define principles of engagement between public and private sectors
  - Upgrade and improve food based dietary guidelines and promote enhanced knowledge about implication of dietary choices.
  - Improve regulation of advertising and marketing (ineffectiveness of businesses self‐regulating).
  - Implement behavioural nudges via carefully designed taxes and subsidises
- **Education and cultural norms**: will be pivotal in changing consumption patterns
- **Equity and social justice**: 
  - The systematic use of full supply chain traceability has been shown to promote internal transparency. This could potentially be a way to promote social justice
  - Deploy safety nets to protect the poor against dynamic food systems transition
- **Governance and decision support tools**:
  - Invest in addition to knowledge, skills and data and tools needed to identify, prioritize and manage trade‐offs and competing priorities.
  - Establish standardisation and clear labelling.
  - Develop tools for measuring consumer and retail food waste at national level, to understand the scale of the problem, identify hotspots for targeted action, and track progress towards SDG 12.3.
  - Increased adherence to principles of circular economy recycling and repurposing food waste becomes the norm.
  - Rationalizing food related sustainability standards.



### Conclusions
A shift towards sustainable consumption patterns is necessary to harmonise global societal and environmental goals and for humanity to prosper sustainably and equitably in the coming years.
Transitioning towards healthy diets from sustainable food systems at the country‐ level is essential to achieve this, together with strategies for managing waste reduction and increase productivity.

The role of science and innovation will be essential for deploying these interventions at scale and at low costs, and for minimising the potential trade‐offs arising. Transparent multi‐stakeholder dialogues will be key at all stages of planning the appropriate transition pathways towards our desired global goals of healthy food, healthy ecosystems and prosperity for all.

## Track 3
**`Boost Nature Positive Production at Sufficient Scale (April 2021)`**  
The overall goal of Action Track 3 is to reconcile the need for the production system to meet the demands from growing populations and rising prosperity with the necessity of restoring the environment, improving the quality of soil, conserving biodiversity, and sustainably managing land, water and other natural resources. 

The strategy is to protect, manage and restore ecosystems: to "produce more from less" and set aside some land and water for nature. In this context, action at the landscape scale is key. Landscapes are where these actors and innovations come together. Nature-positive landscape-level interventions include system-based conservation agriculture, agroforestry, river basin management, bio-inputs, integrated soil fertility management, soil and water conservation and nutrient recycling. 

In particular, maintaining trees in landscapes, avoiding deforestation and promoting landscape restoration are critically important for protecting the soils, water resources and environmental services essential for sustaining production at multiple scales from regional to global. 

**Definition**: 
`Nature-positive food systems` are characterized by a regenerative, non-depleting and non-destructive use of natural resources. It is based on stewardship of the environment and biodiversity as the foundation of critical ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration and soil, water, and climate regulation. Nature Positive Food Systems refer to protection, sustainable management and restoration of productive system. Finally, nature positive food systems cover the growing demand for food in a sufficient way and include sustainable and healthy nutrition.

### 1. Introduction
This paper provides a high-level overview of evidence in favour of nature-positive food systems, discussing opportunities and challenges associated with sustainable, efficient agricultural production with a view to concrete policy suggestions. The aim is to present these complex issues comprehensibly and impartially, so that proposed actions are science-based, solution- oriented, applicable, and restorative; balancing trade-offs and optimizing available synergies.

### 2. What do we want to achieve?
The primary objective of FSS 2021 is to achieve multiple SDGs by internationally coordinated actions across the food system chain (production, distribution, and consumption). More concretely, the overall goal is to provide healthy and nutritious food to all people, while creating livelihood opportunities and reducing the negative environmental, climate, and health impacts associated with food systems. 

Elements of agroecology that must be integrated to a comprehensive approach in nature-positive food systems:
- Diversification and resource use efficiency
- Increased resource efficiency: more with less
- Leverage natural synergies
- Recycling and minimising waste 
- resilience through diversification
- share knowledge and co-create solutions
- human and social values
- Supporting innovation for circular and solidarity economies within the planetary boundaries and reconnecting producers and consumers as the basis for inclusive and sustainable development.

### 3. What do we mean by Nature-Positive Food Systems?
Nature-positive food systems globally meet the fundamental human right to healthy food, while operating within planetary boundaries that limit the natural resources available for a sustainable exploitation

Scientific targets for six key Earth system processes and the control variables used to quantify the planetary boundaries:
- Climate change: Greenhouse-gas (CH4 and N2O) emissions
- Nitrogen cycling: Nitrogen application
- Phosphorus cycling: Phosphorus application
- Freshwater use: Consumptive water use
- Biodiversity loss: Extinction rate
- Land-system change: Cropland use

Nature-based Solutions (NbS) is based on three pillars:
1. **Protect**: natural systems and protected areas from new conversions for food production and save and set aside some land and water back to nature
2. **Sustainably manage**: of existing food production systems in a regenerative, non-depleting, and non-destructive use of natural resources
3. **Restore**: and rehabilitate degraded systems for sustainable food production and ecosystem services

- Nature-positive production hinges upon circular bioeconomy, in which local and regional integration of production, consumption and the use of all residues are integrated and balanced.
- Many rural settlements in Asia and Africa have sustained their productive landscapes for centuries: for example, “satoyama” in Japan
- One-third of global land area is degraded
- Ideal results typically result when scientific knowledge and traditional knowledge cooperate in the production of "wise" approaches to nature-positive production. 

### 4. Challenges of nature-positive food systems
The transition to nature-positive food systems is slowed or made impossible by numerous agronomic, economic and social challenges, which are compounded by deficits in knowledge systems.
1. **Agronomic**
  - Yield reductions related with nature-positive production: The trade- off between high yields and biodiversity-rich, non-commodity ecosystems services such as soil nutrient cycling, soil carbon sequestration, pollination and indirect pest control, is the greatest challenge of the present.
2. **Economic**
  - Higher labour demand: serious constraint when manual labour cannot be substituted by mechanized labour.
  - Higher transaction costs: due to diversification of products and market risk
  - Failed valorisation of sustainability throughout the value chain: cheap food continues to be purchased predominantly. A major challenge is that monocropping of calory-dense food commodities offers large scale-economies and lower unit-costs, as opposed to the more diversified production of a portfolio of food commodities needed for a healthy diet.
3. **Political**
   - Policy incoherence: especially agriculture, environmental, health, trade and science/education policies
4. **Deficits along the agricultural knowledge systems**
   - Weak knowledge and advisory systems: A systems-oriented, transdisciplinary, and long-term field research approach is clearly lacking. Therefore, there is a disconnect in the knowledge and advisory systems required to support nature-positive food systems and build the capacity of actors.

### 5. Call for Actions to successfully cope with trade-offs and to scaling up nature-positive food systems
There are several structural lock-ins that keep the current unsustainable food production system in place. These create a set of feedback loops that reinforce this system and include investments and policies that create path dependency (such as purchasing of expensive equipment or subsidies for chemical pesticides); export orientation; the expectation of cheap food; compartmentalized and sectoral, short-term thinking; certain discourses about feeding the world, focused solely on production volumes and measures of success (looking at single crops).

Other typical lock-ins that reinforce the current system are the concentration of power in the food chain and institutional, agricultural research and technological lock-ins.

Therefore, a systematic change towards nature-positive food systems requires a fundamental reorientation of many societal actors and a realignment of the cooperation between them. The inclusion of local actors, particularly of the most vulnerable voices, in decision-making will lead to more effective solutions. 

The seven calls for action can provide guidance to ensure an integrated, systemic approach:
1. **Increase policy coherence and strengthen adequate governance**: go beyond incentives such as income-oriented subsidies or those for particular inputs or unspecific marketing actions. The decisive level in fostering transition is the landscape. Implement payments for ecosystem services and incentives to invest in sustainability.
2. **Improve sustainable soil management**: land degradation neutrality. By restoration of degraded soils and adoption of nutrition-sensitive agriculture will also improve human health and wellbeing. Nature positive production implies adaptation to climate change, protection and enhancement of soil health and food security. This can be achieved through bioeconomy strategies with the approach of integrated cycles in whole value chains
3. **Boost knowledge and innovation for nature-positive food systems**: 2050 demand for food requires a broad ecological, social and technological innovation strategy. Ecological innovations or optimizations are driven by biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Social innovations include those in the socio-economic space. Technological innovations encompass digitalisation. Measures adopted locally are the most suited to their specific conditions and cultures. Produce more food and fewer negative externalities.
4. **Adapt and intensify the knowledge sharing of farmers, farm advisors and farm teachers**: The scientific knowledge is tremendous, but its integration with the knowledge of farmers, consumers and citizen remains vastly unsatisfactory.  As nature-positive production requires complex decisions, coping with uncertainties and trade-offs, as well as taking higher risks of failures, inter- and transdisciplinary research is a prerequisite.
5. **Strengthen information for citizen on sustainable nutrition and food diets**: The development and scaling-up of nature positive production is dependent on the transition to sustainable consumption and more plant-based diets.
6. **Empower rural areas by cross-farm co-operations and through high local value creation**
7. **Improve access to land, water and biodiversity especially for women**

### 6. Conclusions
Food systems across the world are driving habitat and biodiversity loss, land and water degradation, and greenhouse gas emissions. These phenomena, in turn, undermine theproductivity, sustainability and resilience of food systems. This vicious circle can be broken if we take several fundamental steps to realign our food, feed and fiber production to achieve nature-positive agricultural production at scale.

## Track 4
**`Advance Equitable Livelihoods (March 2021)`**  
The task of Action Track 4 is to explore approaches to Food systems transformation to ensure equitable livelihoods for producers, businesses, workers across the food system and consumers, with particular emphasis on addressing inequalities and power imbalances.
Small and medium sized producers and people living on the food system in rural and urban areas are disproportionately affected by all biophysical and environmental drivers including soil and water resources, and climate change.

The pandemic is having a significant impact on the global commodity markets and trading systems, economic growth, incomes, and poverty levels, with likely disproportionate burden on the vulnerable communities in both urban and rural areas. 

### Introduction
The central issue identified by the AT 4 team has been stated as:

> Inequality and power imbalances – at household, community, national and global levels – are consistently constraining the ability of food systems to deliver poverty reduction and sustainable, equitable livelihoods.

In developing solutions, AT 4 explicitly calls out inequities related to gender, youth, elderly, minority, migrant, and indigenous peoples. They focus on small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) across the food value chain, but also equitable access to employment and livelihoods for wage earners, extending the concerns of inequality to rural/ urban and other social and geographic divides.

Efforts to address inequality and power imbalances must: 
- **Build Agency**: building consciousness, confidence, self-esteem and aspirations (non-formal sphere) and knowledge, skills and capabilities (formal sphere)
- **Change Relations**: the power relations through which people live their lives through intimate relations and social networks (non-formal sphere) and group membership and activism, and citizen and amrket negotiations (formal sphere)
- **Transform Structures**: discriminatory social norms, customs, values and exclusionary practices (non-formal sphere) and laws, policies, procedres and services (formal sphere)

### Framework
- 📗 HLPE 15 - Food security and nutrition.pdf

We use the conceptual framework of sustainable food systems drivers (reduced from HLPE)
1. **Biophysical and Environmental**: soil, water, and climate change. Small and medium sized producers and people living on the food system in rural and urban areas are disproportionately affected by all biophysical and environmental drivers including soil and water resources. Land degradation and climate change act as threat multipliers.
2. **Technology, Innovation and Infrastructure**: infrastructure influences the food chain. It is required for food to move long distances and to increase food security in areas of shortages, to stabilize food prices, to minimize food-borne disease and food waste. With access to data, markets, and financial services, farmers can plant, fertilize, harvest, and sell products more effectively. 
3. **Economic and Political**: globalization and trade have a critical role to play in ensuring food security and nutrition (FSN) and reducing inequalities. Stabilizing food prices will help to reduce the risk of all stakeholders along the food supply chains and will bring benefits to the small holders who are more vulnerable in the production system and consumers in rural and urban.
4. **Socio-Cultural and Demographic**: there are approximately 185 million indigenous women in the world, belonging to more than 5000 different indigenous peoples. Past and present social and environmental injustices have led to the loss of food sovereignty, through dispossessing Indigenous peoples from their traditional territories and undermining intergenerational knowledge transmission of cultural practices related to their food systems. Inequality of opportunity is an important constraint. Increased urbanization means a growing gap between the location of food production and food consumption. It may also mean a change in lifestyle including dietary changes. Reliable data, disaggregated by sex, age, origin and destination are necessary to understand socio-economic conditions associated with migration.

### The unprecedented range of COVID-19 disruptions to the food system and livelihoods
The impact from the pandemic parallels or exceeds the impact of major shocks over the past few decades, whether caused by natural disasters, disruption of financial and commodity markets, or conflict and civil strife.
There are important lessons to be learned from the current pandemic to help shape more effective strategies to managing future shocks and their impact on the livelihood of the excluded and marginalised.
- The Effects of Covid on marginalized communities: Income, poverty, and nutrition
- Equity and policy responses to Covid and similar shocks: better handle on equity and vulnerability before shocks strike.
- Lessons for managing future shocks to protect livelihoods: Investment in the capacity for good understanding of the patterns of vulnerability across various communities
- good understanding of the nature of operation of local food systems.
- investment in a minimum infrastructure for real time data access and management for better targeting and tracking in order to raise the effectiveness of response and mitigation measures to protect the poor and vulnerable.

### Conclusions
Food system transformation must address the drivers of inequality and also find the balance of food systems that favour and support healthy diets and do so in ways that are sustainable for the planet. 

We believe therefore, that enhancing equitable livelihoods will require solutions that:
1. **Are rights-based**: living wage, right to food and then right to a healthy diet. Create monitoring and accountability mechanisms.
2. **Ensure long-term investment for structural changes**: while achieving short term gains
   - access to resources, technology, infrastructure and productive services among smallholders and other less powerful actors along the food system
   - markets and trading regimes work for producers and consumers
   - ensure equitable access to productive assets
3. **Directly inform local and national policy and programmes**: breaking down of current policy silos in favour of coordinated policy agendas that permit the mapping and balancing of trade-off, benefits, and harms to human and planetary health.
4. **Enhance the development of and equitable deployment of contextually relevant innovation and technology**: systems must be strengthened to ensure it does not exacerbate inequalities, and to ensure that the balance of potential benefits and harms can be assessed

### Recommendations

- **Alter power structures to enhance inclusive decision-making**:
  - Examples of key international organizations include FAO, IFAD, WFP, the World Bank Group, CGIAR, among others.
  - Engage a coalition of local, regional, and international research institutions to generate and test a framework and indicators
  - accountability mechanism to track progress
  - explore demographic, social, and cultural aspects that may influence participation in decision-making
- **Protect the livelihoods of those living in situations of vulnerability, while creating opportunities**: 
  - A promising model of boosting productivity and improving livelihoods through skills development, advisory services financial transfer is the FOMENTO model from Brazil.
  - technology models to predict climate and other agricultural risks: Climate Information Service. Econometric studies highlight CIS as one of the most important factors influencing adaptation and transformation of farming systems. 
- **Adapt institutions and policies to favour equitable food systems livelihoods**
  - favour the production, distribution, and consumption of nutritious over unhealthy foods, produced with territorial approaches that favour planetary health, and ensure equitable livelihoods for producers and wage-earners across the food system
- **Increase investment to realize the potential of improved institutional and policy actions**
  - 📗 Cluster based industrialization which provide a critical mass of infrastructure, services, and networking opportunities.
  - 📗 Kaizen model from Japan, which has been recently tested in Africa with promising results
- **Hold governments, businesses, and organizations to account for ensuring equitable livelihoods**
  - coalition to generate and test a framework and indicators
  - accountability mechanism to track progress
- **Realize the potential of science, innovation, technology, and evidence to favour equitable livelihoods**
  - New approaches are instrumental to revitalize Indigenous food systems and to produce, process, and consume food in culturally relevantand ecologically sustainable ways
  - Improve the availability, quality, accessibility, and use of data that can map and inform actions to reduce inequalities in the food systems.

## Track 5
**`Building Resilience to Vulnerabilities, Shocks and Stresses (March 2021)`**
Transforming food systems involves five action tracks:i) access to safe and nutritious food, ii) sustainable consumption, iii) nature-positive production, iv) equitable livelihood, and v) resilience to shocks and stress.

Action Track 5 of the Food Systems Summit aims to ensure `food system resilience` in the face of increasing stresses from climate change, population growth and conflict over limited natural resources.

**Five capacities of resilient food systems**: 
1. to **anticipate**
2. to **prevent**
3. to **absorb**
4. to **adapt** to an evolving risk
5. to **transform** in cases where the current food system is no longer sustainable.

Resilience at the individual, community, government and global food system level must be built in such a way that the economic, social and environmental bases to generate food security and nutrition for current and future generations are not compromised anywhere in the world. This means that it is equitable in a financial sense (economic resilience), it is supportive of the entire community (social resilience), and it minimizes harmful impacts on the natural environment (ecological resilience).

There are a number of key trade-offs which must be navigated: the need to deliver short term humanitarian aid without jeopardizing long run development, mitigation of rising global temperatures even as the food system adapts to the inevitable changes in the earth’s climate, taking advantage of the benefits of globalization while avoiding the downsides, and encouraging agricultural production and boosting rural incomes while also protecting the environment.

The resilience framework is helpful to conceptualise complex problems related to food security and allows us to point to important challenges that need to be overcome. Developing an operational resilience approach is always context-specific. Hence, there is no single game changing solution that will ensure resilience across multiple food security challenges.

### Introduction
Building resilience requires clear understanding and consideration of the specific food system context. Conceptual ideas need to be operationalized, developing concrete measures and processes for the five capacities of resilient food system (anticipate, prevent, absorb, adapt, transform).

### Challenges and Ambitions
Food systems are becoming increasingly global, dynamic, and complex.
Successful management of socio-ecological systems necessitates understanding the contextual factors that drive changes in resource-use patterns and influence societal capacity to adapt in the face of stresses.
Perceptions of risk, preference, belief, knowledge, and experience are key factors determining whether and how adaptation takes place – both at the individual and societal levels. Elements of good community-level governance such as social cohesion, leadership, or individual support for collective action improve the perception that people have of the resilience of their community.

Creation of a food system that delivers broad-based benefits for all people, requires covering all the societal bases of equity and inclusiveness, requires actions at both the individual and societal levels. Capacity building for resilient food systems is a non-static process.

### Key Trade-Offs and Synergies
Over the next decade, food systems will face a complex challenge to deliver sufficient safe and nutritious food for all in a sustainable manner in the face of a changing climate, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and preserving ecosystems and biodiversity, and also providing equitable livelihoods to all the actors in the food chain and promoting sustainable development. Attainment of these diverse goals while ensuring food system resilience gives rise to complex synergies and trade-offs across economic, political, social and environmental dimensions that need to be considered in setting priorities across productivity growth, environmental sustainability and hunger reduction 
   - 📃 Resilience of local food systems and links to food security – A review of some important concepts in the context of COVID-19 and other shocks

Most salient trade-offs and synergies:
- **Short term humanitarian aid vs. Long term development assistance**: <1% of emergency assistance goes to disaster prevention and preparedness
- **Rural and Urban communities**: conflict frequently arises at the boundary of agriculture and forests where encroachment on natural habitat can lead to conflict. Agriculture accounts for nearly three-quarters of water consumption globally. Migration can also provide an important adaptation strategy to climate related risks
- **Climate change adaptation and mitigation**: by climate-smart agriculture approach(CSA); agriculture that sustainably increases productivity, enhances resilience (adaptation), reduces/removes GHGs (mitigation) where possible, and enhances achievement of national food security and development goals. Actions tailored to the specific conditions
- **Globalization vs. self-sufficiency**: Better integration into world markets can ensure food security in the face of local drought, flooding and other natural disasters. However, when the source of adverse shocks is the global market, countries may have an incentive to insulate themselves from these developments. The problem with this strategy is that, the more countries insulate themselves from world markets, the more volatile those markets will become
- **Livestock production as a source of income and nutrition vs. environmental sustainability**: Beef production, in particular, has been shown to be extremely resource intensive, resulting in significant environmental stress. However, in many developing countries, livestock products are a critical source of dietary diversity – particularly in the critical first 1,000 days of life.
- **All of these trade-offs are made more challenging in the context of small farms, operating in marginal environments**: these farms account for only 12% of the world’s farmland, they provide livelihoods for more than 2 billion people and produce about 80% of the food in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. These marginalized communities will benefit from risk informed and safety net social protection schemes as well as remuneration for ecosystem services they can provide through wise management and custodianship of renewable natural resources

### What Needs to be Done?
To address these resilience challenges, solutions need to be defined around cross cutting levers of joined-up policy reform, coordinated investment, accessible financing, innovation, traditional knowledge, governance, data and evidence, and empowerment.

Examples:
- **Early warning system**: There are now nearly two dozen organizations involved in food security and drought early warning systems. The joint FAO-World Food Program Early Warning System now provides up to date analysis of acute food security hotspots and plays a key role at the global level. 
- **Weather index insurance**: As climate extremes become more frequent and more pronounced in the future, producers will face increasing risks. nsured farmers have boosted savings, increased the number of oxen and increased access to loans.
- **Enhanced market information**: Increased digitalization of trade regulations and monitoring has facilitated more rapid movement of critical goods. AMIS provides up to date information on agricultural commodity prices and availability, thereby preventing over-reactions on the part of governments and markets. This has resulted in far more resilient global markets for agricultural products.
- **Addressing food insecurity in conflict zones**: climate change is a key driver of conflict. The combination of conditional food assistance and asset creation work helps food-insecure communities to shift away from reliance on humanitarian aid to achieve more sustainable food security. The crisis in Somalia offers an example of the compound risks from severe weather events coinciding with conflict.
- **Social protection**: The goal is to help these households build assets which can sustain them through future crises, along with contributing to the construction of rural infrastructure. Integrating smallholders more fully into regional markets can also enhance resilience.
- **Aquaculture diversification**
- **Postharvest loss reduction**
- **Development, dissemination and utilization of agricultural big data**: CGIAR-[INSPIRE](https:// bigdata.cgiar.org/inspire). There is also an increasing emphasis on integrated systems approaches in which farming practices seek to imitate nature’s ecological principles. Integrate knowledge generation with knowledge sharing. Accurate weather forecasting is critical for farming community.
- **Enhanced equity in food systems**
- **Agro-ecology**
- **Trans-national policy coordination**: ensure food safety along the entire food chain. Include elements of quality control and quality assurance systems, food safety standards, risk analysis, diagnostic technology, and traceability systems. 
- **Food safety policies**: Poor hygienic practices in the home are responsible for between 30-40% of food-borne illness
- **Community organization and local innovation**

### The Importance of Context Specificity
Resilience interventions will have differential impacts depending on their agroecological context, cultural aspects, policies and institutional capacities. Solutions cannot be “one size fits all”. 
Enhancing agricultural development for marginal farmers and smallholders can create strong links to the rest of the rural sector.
Resilience and vulnerability strongly depends on the ability to adapt to climate change which again depends of economic conditions with poorer, less diversified regions being more vulnerable

### Concluding Remarks
resilience has successfully been used as a conceptual framework to improve food security as well as vehicle for organizing links among respective actors, agencies and institutions.
- None of the studies integrates all capacities. The ones behind are prevention and transformation
- systematic approaches for analysis of trade-offs are often missing.
- links among programs are often not well developed, additional benefits are missed 
- there is no single game-changing solution that solves the range of different food security challenges
- using resilience as a systems approach to support the conceptualization of the food security challenge and the integration of actors, organizations and agencies to develop context-specific solutions offers a promising way forward
