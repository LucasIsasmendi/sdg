## Healthy diet: A definition for the United Nations Food Systems Summit 2021 (March 2021)
Diets are combinations of foods consumed by individuals of a given time. The specific combination of foods that make up healthy diets, however, is context specific and depends on many **cultural, economic, and other factors**(🤨).

### Definition  
A healthy diet is health-promoting and disease-preventing. It provides adequacy without excess, of nutrients and health promoting substances from `nutritious foods` and avoids the consumption of `health-harming substances`.

### *Annex 1: Defining nutritious foods*
#### *The distinction between diets and foods*

Diets are the combination of foods consumed over time, through which we achieve adequacy without excess of all nutrients (including energy). Foods that make up a healthy diet should be safe, and nutritious.

> A nutritious food is “one that provides beneficial nutrients (e.g. protein, vitamins, minerals, essential amino acids, essential fatty acids, dietary fibre) and minimizes potentially harmful elements (e.g. antinutrients, quantities of sodium, saturated fats, sugars)”

While conceptually simple, there is no straightforward, universally accepted approach to classifying individual foods as more or less nutritious. Similarly, some context specificity is required in the categorization of individual foods as nutritious. The same food, for example, whole fat milk, may provide much-needed energy and other nutrients to one population group (e.g., underweight 3-year-old children), but be less “healthy” for another due to high energy (calories) and fat content (e.g., obese adults).

`Nutrient profiling` or the rating of foods based on their nutrient density (i.e., nutrient content per 100 g or per 100 kcal of energy or per serving) has evolved substantially in recent years as an approach to classifying individual foods as more or less nutritious (🤓). Recent efforts have also proposed more complete profiling approaches that, in addition to nutrient density, take into consideration the food groups of ingredients (e.g., fruit or vegetable content), and further develop the content of ingredients (e.g., types of fat) that should be limited. To date, nutrient-profiling has been used predominantly for packaged foods in many high-income and several middle-income countries. Considerable limitations remain for extending its utility to unpackaged foods and in contexts where a large portion of food is not commercially produced (💻).

#### *Several evidence gaps and controversies that influence our ability to characterize health diets and nutritious foods:*

- **Imperfect characterization of population nutrient requirements to avoid deficiency and promote health**: Estimated average requirements are developed and converted into recommended daily nutrient intake levels that will ensure that the requirements of 95% of the population are met. Some experts are now calling for additional research to estimate requirements using a consistent approach. Emerging evidence suggests that eventually, dietary recommendations may be personalized to optimize human health outcomes based on individual characteristics, but science is still far from achieving this goal.

- **Lack of consensus and standardized definitions related to food processing and health implications**: A growing body of evidence suggests that highly processed foods (or ultra- processed foods) are human health-harming. Recent studies have also highlighted the impact of such foods on the environment. Urgent consensus is needed on how to classify such foods, define food processing categories and operationalize the implications for the private sector. 32-36

### *Annex 2: Avoiding consumption of health-harming substances*
#### Bringing safety to the definition of healthy diets:
Food safety refers to “all those hazards, whether chronic or acute, that may make food injurious to the health of the consumer”
The FERG/WHO report quantified the burden of disease from the most critical food borne toxins (aflatoxin, cassava cyanide and dioxins).
Some work has also been done to estimate the burden of illness due to four food-borne metals (arsenic, cadmium, lead, methylmercury), which is estimated to be substantial.As with nutrition, our evidence related to food safety and health continues to evolve. For example, the clinical outcome of exposure to food-borne pathogens may be modulated by the human gut microbiome.

Food safety system performance and related disease outcomes are predominantly utilised in high-income countries (HICs). `Food safety` ensures that food is fit for human consumption and not harmful to human health and is most often under the competence of veterinary, health or agricultural inspectors. `Food quality` is a market category that is usually the responsibility of food or market inspectors

#### Several evidence gaps and controversies that influence the ability to assess and ensure the safety of foods as part of a healthy diet:
- **Food safety has complex interactions with other societal concerns**: In many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), food is often purchased from traditional markets close to the point of production and undergoes limited transformation
- **The preferred method for improving food safety and quality is preventive, and many but not all potential food hazards can be controlled along the food chain**. Engaging the food industry at all levels to understand their role in preventing food contamination through the application of good practices, i.e., good agricultural practices (GAP), good manufacturing practices (GMP), good hygienic practices (GHP), and the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point system (HACCP) is challenging. (💻) In addition to HACCP, the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) sets standards to address the safety and nutritional quality of foods for most segments of the food chain to protect consumer health and fair practices. The CAC establishes standards for maximum levels of food additives, limits for contaminants and toxins, and residue limits for pesticides and veterinary drugs.
- **Some countries, especially LMIC, have not adopted modern food safety control systems even though there is a significant burden of food-related illness**

### Approaches to translating healthy diet into specific food-based recommendations
1. observed dietary patterns in populations where certain diseases, usually non-communicable diseases (NCDs), appear less prevalent. Example: Mediterranean diet. They do not consider all potential health outcomes.
2. quantify the specific dietary intake patterns associated with multiple outcomes - both human and environmental or planetary health. Principles to guide a `sustainable, healthy diet`, based primarily on eating local and minimizing processed food were published as early as 1986 (😀).
     - 🔬: EAT-Lancet Commission on Healthy Diets from Sustainable Food Systems
3. The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified a series of guiding principles for healthy diets that seek to address all forms of malnutrition and related health issues: `food-based dietary guidelines` (FBDG).

### Conclusion
This brief defines a healthy diet for the Food Systems Summit, placing human health-promotion and disease-prevention at the center. In doing so, we draw attention to food safety. Without ensuring safety, diets cannot nourish and instead will cause illness.

There will always be tensions between the indicative or guiding principles and approaches that propose more quantified recommendations. The former leaves much room for interpretation. The latter tends to underestimate the complexities of extrapolating prescribed diets to varying age, sex, life-stage, culture, food availability, affordability, among other considerations. 

The FAO and WHO have now set out a series of guiding principles to achieve contextually appropriate sustainable, affordable, healthy diets (15,16)

## Food Systems – Definition, Concept and Application for the UN Food Systems Summit (March 2021) 

`Transformation` is a never-ending process in food systems. `Transition` is the movement from one state to another. And `evolution` is the process of change. These are not interchangeable terminologies. Most food systems need all three. 

The food system is largely structured by private sector actors, including farmers, food manufacturers, traders, retailers, or food service businesses. 
Nature-Positive Production, `nature positive`, imply a narrative that may be surprising and new, not rooted in the established research literature or in terminology of SDGs. 
the Food Systems Summit needs to be open to new thinking, to new concepts, and to establishing new institutional and organizational arrangements. Addressing symptoms of systems failures will not be sufficient. 

The five Action Tracks capture various key opportunities and challenges of food systems and relate to one or more food systems components, but they do not define a food systems concept as such. Therefore, the pursuit of the Action Tracks needs to be conscious of an overarching food systems concept. Pursuing each in isolation from the others would lead to inefficient solution proposals that neglect system-wide effects. 
The Tracks should better be understood as **interlinked Action Areas**. 

### Considering Culture and Values (🤨)
Survey shows whether they think protecting the environment should be the priority, or whether economic growth and jobs should be prioritized. There are differences. This hints at the challenges of finding consensus among and within countries on food systems actions. 

For transformative policy approaches to be acceptable they will need to take into account values and cultural traditions. 

### Main Objectives 
The Action Tracks need a systems frame that defines sustainable food systems that deliver health and nutrition within the scope of the following three objectives: 
1. **End hunger** and achieve **healthy diets** for all. It is important to understand the interactions between diets, health systems, and food systems to make progress towards the SDGs and their related targets in agriculture, inequality, poverty, sustainable production, consumption, nutrition, and health. 
2. **sustainable use of biodiversity and natural resources**, the **protection of ecosystems** and the safeguarding of land, oceans, forests, freshwater, and climate 
3. Eliminate poverty and increase income and wealth. Changing food systems need to ensure that people with a low income can access a healthy diet by enabling them to earn living wages.

In addition, reduction of risks and the fostering of **food systems’ resilience** 

### Concluding Remarks 
Food systems transformation has to have a perspective on where we want to be headed. We then need to understand what is entailed in the transition to desirable food systems, and how to facilitate the evolution of such food systems. Thus, a vision for food systems transformation is required, and pursued with a strong sense of urgency. 

> “Science and policy have a lot to gain from cooperation, but the independence of science must not be compromised to, for example, counter conventional wisdom or address policy and institutional failures with evidence-based insights. Science that produces new insights and technologies also needs to constantly seek the trust of society.“ (😒)
