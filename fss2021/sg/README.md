## Healthy diet: A definition for the United Nations Food Systems Summit 2021 (March 2021)
Diets are combinations of foods consumed by individuals of a given time. The specific combination of foods that make up healthy diets, however, is context specific and depends on many **cultural, economic, and other factors**(🤨).

**Definition:**
A healthy diet is health-promoting and disease-preventing. It provides adequacy without excess, of nutrients and health promoting substances from `nutritious foods` and avoids the consumption of `health-harming substances`.

Approaches to translating healthy diet into specific food-based recommendations:
- observed dietary patterns in populations where certain diseases, usually non-communicable diseases (NCDs), appear less prevalent. Example: Mediterranean diet. They do not onsider all potential health outcomes.

## Food Systems – Definition, Concept and Application for the UN Food Systems Summit (March 2021) 

`Transformation` is a never-ending process in food systems. `Transition` is the movement from one state to another. And `evolution` is the process of change. These are not interchangeable terminologies. Most food systems need all three. 

The food system is largely structured by private sector actors, including farmers, food manufacturers, traders, retailers, or food service businesses. 
Nature-Positive Production, `nature positive`, imply a narrative that may be surprising and new, not rooted in the established research literature or in terminology of SDGs. 
the Food Systems Summit needs to be open to new thinking, to new concepts, and to establishing new institutional and organizational arrangements. Addressing symptoms of systems failures will not be sufficient. 

The five Action Tracks capture various key opportunities and challenges of food systems and relate to one or more food systems components, but they do not define a food systems concept as such. Therefore, the pursuit of the Action Tracks needs to be conscious of an overarching food systems concept. Pursuing each in isolation from the others would lead to inefficient solution proposals that neglect system-wide effects. 
The Tracks should better be understood as **interlinked Action Areas**. 

### Considering Culture and Values (🤨)
Survey shows whether they think protecting the environment should be the priority, or whether economic growth and jobs should be prioritized. There are differences. This hints at the challenges of finding consensus among and within countries on food systems actions. 

For transformative policy approaches to be acceptable they will need to take into account values and cultural traditions. 

### Main Objectives 
The Action Tracks need a systems frame that defines sustainable food systems that deliver health and nutrition within the scope of the following three objectives: 
1. **End hunger** and achieve **healthy diets** for all. It is important to understand the interactions between diets, health systems, and food systems to make progress towards the SDGs and their related targets in agriculture, inequality, poverty, sustainable production, consumption, nutrition, and health. 
2. **sustainable use of biodiversity and natural resources**, the **protection of ecosystems** and the safeguarding of land, oceans, forests, freshwater, and climate 
3. Eliminate poverty and increase income and wealth. Changing food systems need to ensure that people with a low income can access a healthy diet by enabling them to earn living wages.

In addition, reduction of risks and the fostering of **food systems’ resilience** 

### Concluding Remarks 
Food systems transformation has to have a perspective on where we want to be headed. We then need to understand what is entailed in the transition to desirable food systems, and how to facilitate the evolution of such food systems. Thus, a vision for food systems transformation is required, and pursued with a strong sense of urgency. 

> “Science and policy have a lot to gain from cooperation, but the independence of science must not be compromised to, for example, counter conventional wisdom or address policy and institutional failures with evidence-based insights. Science that produces new insights and technologies also needs to constantly seek the trust of society.“ (😒)
