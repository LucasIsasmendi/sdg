This event aims to:

Promote health and food systems resilience as critical to COVID-19 recovery.
Communicate why we need new food systems narratives centered around upholding human, ecological, and animal health (i.e., One Health) and why dominant narratives are undermining all three dimensions of health as well as the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Catalyze support for an integrated, holistic approach to policy reform and coordinated action across food and health sectors, exploring opportunities for health and food system actors to work together for policy and practice reform.
Using case studies from around the world, showcase how government leaders, the health sector and other food system actors have designed policies and practices that have delivered better health and sustainability outcomes for all.
