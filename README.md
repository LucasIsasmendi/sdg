# Kuizen Knowledge Base
## Welcome
This is a repository to share the knowledge that nurtures [kuizen.org](https://kuizen.org/); a project to develop **the food system that will restore our planetary health**.

We check [UN Food Systems Summit 2021](https://www.un.org/en/food-systems-summit),books, papers, reports, publications, MOOCs, podcasts, events.

We use [github](https://github.com/) to host this information because is open-source, public available and community oriented (and also because we love open source).  
You can check this repo directly at [knowledge-base](https://github.com/kuizen-org/knowledge-base)
