This is a repository to share the knowledge that nurtures [kuizen.org](https://kuizen.org/); a project to develop **the food system that will restore our planetary health**.

Our outputs are summaries, resumes and notes grouped into:

- MOOCS (Massive Open Online Courses)
- Books
- True Cost Accounting
- Publications
- Organizations

We use [github](https://github.com/) to host this information because is open-source, public available and community oriented (and also because we love open source).
